My master\r\nwill be with you shortly.\r\n\r\nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the\r\ndoor and it closes.

OBI-WAN is\r\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\r\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\r\nQUI-GON : I don't sense anything.\r\nOBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's\r\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\r\nQUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\r\nhere and now where it belongs.\r\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\r\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the\r\nliving Force, my young Padawan.\r\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with\r\nthe chancellor's demands?\r\nQUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards.

Blast, what's left of them.\r\n\r\nThe hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the\r\ndoor. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their\r\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\r\ntray of drinks.\r\n\r\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\r\n\r\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\r\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\r\ncan fire.\r\n\r\nINT.

There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs\r\nthe door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the\r\ncenter of the blast door.\r\n\r\nRUNE : ...They're still coming through!\r\n\r\nOn the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.\r\n\r\nNUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!\r\nRUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!\r\n\r\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\r\n\r\nTen ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just\r\nbefore they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their\r\nbattle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Destroyer droids!\r\nOBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.\r\n\r\nThe WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,\r\nblasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a\r\nsemi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nP-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!\r\n\r\nThe Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the\r\ndoorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with\r\ntheir laser swords.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : They have shield generators!\r\nQUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!\r\n\r\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nNUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL\r\nDROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.\r\n\r\nRUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer\r\ndroids.\r\nTEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.\r\n\r\nINT.

Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Battle droids.\r\nOBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.\r\nQUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the\r\nNaboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate\r\nships and meet down on the planet.\r\nOBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nTEY HOW recieves a transmission.\r\n\r\nTEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.\r\nRUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.\r\nNUTE : At last we're getting results.\r\n\r\nOn the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her\r\nelaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING\r\nCOUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.\r\n\r\nNUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is\r\npleased.\r\nAMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,\r\nViceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.\r\n\r\nNUTE smirks at RUNE.\r\n\r\nNUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.\r\nAMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of\r\nyours.\r\nNUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.\r\nAMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's\r\nAmbassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a\r\nsettlement.\r\nNUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.\r\nNUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of\r\nthe Senate. You assume too much.\r\nAMIDALA : We will see.\r\n\r\nThe QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.\r\n\r\nRUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....\r\nNUTE : It's too late now.\r\nRUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?\r\nNUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications\r\ndown there.\r\n\r\nINT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a\r\nhologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the\r\nChancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be\r\nthe...get...negotiate...\r\n\r\nThe hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT\r\n\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...\r\nBIBBLE : A malfunction?\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.\r\nBIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.\r\nAMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not\r\ndare go that far.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be\r\nfinished.\r\nAMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.\r\nBIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the\r\nChancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend\r\nourselves.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security\r\nvolunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.\r\nAMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.\r\n\r\nEXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)\r\n\r\nSix landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.\r\n\r\nEXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT\r\n\r\nThree landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the\r\nperpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation\r\nwarships land in the eerie swamp.\r\nOBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the\r\nbackground, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.\r\nOBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy\r\nswamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.\r\n\r\nEXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)\r\n\r\nThe droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.\r\nOOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the\r\nrolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.\r\n\r\nRUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one\r\nof your landing craft.\r\nOOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of\r\nthe swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.\r\nNUTE : Excellent.\r\n\r\nEXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT\r\n\r\nQUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the\r\nmonstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run\r\npast him in a panic.\r\nAn odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has\r\nretrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue\r\nsnaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.\r\nJAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the\r\nwind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a\r\ncharging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam\r\nshell in one hand.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is\r\ncaught by surprise.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!\r\nQUI-GON : Let go!\r\n\r\nThe machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.\r\nJust as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes\r\nsplat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.\r\nQUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the\r\nwar machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!\r\n\r\nThe frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!\r\nJAR JAR : I spake.\r\nQUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.

QUI-GON deflects the bolts\r\nback, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to\r\ncatch his breath.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR\r\nJAR pulls himself out of the mud.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I\r\nhope you've learned, my young Padawan.\r\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master.\r\nJAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?\r\nOBI-WAN : What's this?\r\nQUI-GON : A local.

You have done well, Viceroy.\r\nNUTE : Thank you, My Lord.\r\n\r\nDARTH SIDIOUS fades away.\r\n\r\nRUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?\r\nNUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.\r\n\r\nINT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER\r\n\r\nSparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the\r\npower drive drops.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.\r\nJAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and\r\nnooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?\r\nOBI-WAN : Power's back.\r\n\r\nThe lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Monstairs back!\r\n\r\nThe large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around\r\nand speeds away.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??\r\nQUI-GON : Relax.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : You overdid it.\r\n\r\nThe COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the\r\ntunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR regains consciousness.\r\nJAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the\r\ndeadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so\r\nlucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips\r\naway.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.\r\n\r\nEXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)\r\n\r\nThe long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to\r\nTheed, the Naboo capital.\r\n\r\nEXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)\r\n\r\nAs the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport\r\ncarrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.\r\n\r\nNUTE : Ah, victory!\r\n\r\nINT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)\r\n\r\nThe little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is\r\nbrightly lit.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Wesa dude it!\r\n\r\nEXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY\r\n\r\nParadise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD\r\nRUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.\r\nThe current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast\r\nmoving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.\r\nQUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Wesa safe now.\r\nQUI-GON : Get this thing started.\r\nJAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?\r\nOBI-WAN : What is it?\r\n\r\nJAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a\r\nhuge waterfall.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly\r\nbegin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the\r\nwaterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop\r\ndrifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In\r\nthe background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs\r\nand dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!\r\n\r\nQUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the\r\nshore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs\r\nprecariously over the edge of the waterfall.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Come on...\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON\r\nstarts in after him.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.\r\nJAR JAR : No! Too scary!\r\nOBI-WAN : Get up here!\r\nJAR JAR : No a mighty no!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to\r\npull QUI-GON out of the water.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : That was close.\r\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!\r\n\r\nThe TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.\r\nJAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.\r\n\r\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons\r\n\r\nQUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut\r\ndown by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks\r\nlose, crashing down the waterfall.\r\nThe JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Whoa!!!\r\n\r\nEXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY\r\n\r\nThe waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.\r\n\r\nINT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,\r\nPADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and\r\nFOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the\r\nmiddle of the room.\r\n\r\nBIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?\r\nNUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will\r\nlegitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by\r\nthe Senate.\r\nAMIDALA : I will not co-operate.\r\nNUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in\r\nstore for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see\r\nour point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.\r\nOOM-9 : Yes, sir!

PALACE - PLAZA - DAY\r\n\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO\r\nBIBBLE,\r\nand FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza\r\nis filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the\r\ndetention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak\r\nacross on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an\r\nattack to rescue the QUEEN.\r\n\r\nFOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are\r\nalso cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the\r\nDROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to\r\nQUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!\r\n\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.\r\nThey move between two buildings.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme\r\nChancellor.\r\nBIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.\r\nQUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make\r\ncontact with the republic.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.\r\n\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.\r\nQUI-GON : Do you have transports?\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.\r\n\r\nTHEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded\r\n\r\nINT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks\r\nin over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are\r\nbehind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE\r\nDROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.\r\n\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.\r\nQUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the\r\ncircumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.\r\nAMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.\r\nQUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.\r\nBIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of\r\ntheirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.\r\nQUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else\r\nbehind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move\r\nhere. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.\r\nBIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate\r\nto side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.\r\nAny attempt to escape will be dangerous.\r\nBIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have\r\nto retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you\r\nmust leave...\r\n\r\nThe QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...\r\nPADME : We are brave, Your Highness.\r\nQUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.\r\nAMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate.

SIO BIBBLE, YANE and\r\nSACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.\r\n\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a\r\ncorner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of\r\ncaptured pilots.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP\r\napproach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.\r\n\r\nGUARD DROID : Where are you going?\r\nQUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those\r\npeople to Coruscant.\r\nDROID GUARD : You're under arrest!\r\n\r\nThe DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,\r\nthey are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the\r\nGUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS\r\nrush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC\r\nOLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER\r\nPILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR.

JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five\r\nshort, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for\r\nthier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?\r\n\r\nJAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.\r\nHe lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying\r\nout.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!\r\nRIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main\r\npower drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.\r\n\r\nThe lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The\r\nNaboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.\r\n\r\nRIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive\r\nis leaking.\r\nQUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The\r\nTrade Federation has no presence there.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?\r\nQUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??\r\nOBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are\r\ngangsters... If they discovered her...\r\nQUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system\r\ncontrolled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,\r\nwhich gives us an advantage.\r\n\r\nCPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.\r\n\r\nEXT.

It deserves our\r\ngratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.\r\nIt is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will\r\nbe able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.\r\nCAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled\r\nby an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on\r\nthis.\r\nQUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA and PADME exchange looks.

I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They\r\nlive on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in\r\nthe universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most\r\nhardened spice pirate cry.\r\n\r\nPADME looks at him, not knowing what to say.

It\r\nwould be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all\r\nthis?\r\nQUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.\r\nWATTO : Republic credits?!?

QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand\r\nagain.\r\nQUI-GON : Credits will do fine.\r\nWATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your\r\nhand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only\r\nmoney. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,\r\nI promise you that.\r\n\r\nINT.

I'm making my own droid...\r\n\r\nQUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.\r\nJAR JAR follows QUI-GON.

MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY\r\n\r\nQUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two\r\nbuildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking\r\ncreatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously\r\nwatches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on\r\nboard?\r\nOBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.\r\nNot enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking\r\nabout.\r\nQUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR\r\ngrabs his arm.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un\r\ncrunched.\r\nQUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.\r\n\r\nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY\r\n\r\nQUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is\r\nwalking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough\r\ngang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like\r\ncreature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs\r\nhanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks\r\nout his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.\r\nUnfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!\r\n\r\nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets\r\naround the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR\r\nmoves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the\r\nhapless Gungan.\r\n\r\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :\r\n(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)\r\n\r\nSEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER\r\nCREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan\r\ndesperately tries to scramble to safety.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??\r\nANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up\r\nto SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,\r\nSebulba...This one's very connected.)\r\n\r\nSEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.\r\n\r\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected??

Una noto wo shag, me wompity du\r\npom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)\r\n\r\nSEBULBA turns away.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if\r\nyou had to pay for me.)\r\n\r\nQUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange\r\ngoo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called\r\nSebulba.\r\nJAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.\r\nQUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.\r\nThank you, my young friend.\r\n\r\nPADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down\r\nthe crowded street.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!\r\nANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by\r\nsquashing you...be less afraid.\r\nPADME : And that works for you.\r\nANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)\r\n\r\nEXT.

(to Padme) You'll like these...\r\n\r\nANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.\r\nQUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nThe wind picks up.

Annie, what's this?\r\nANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know\r\nany of your names.\r\nQUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a\r\nlittle beep.\r\nPADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.\r\nANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?\r\nSHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?\r\nANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom.

ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.\r\nQUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to\r\nSHMI.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.\r\nSHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll\r\nnever get used to Anakin's surprises.\r\nQUI-GON : He's a very special boy.

He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!\r\n\r\nANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs\r\nan eye and puts it in one of the sockets.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How\r\nmight I serve you?\r\nPADME : He's perfect.\r\nANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a\r\nPodracer!\r\n\r\nPADME smiles at his enthusiasm.

CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.\r\n\r\nDARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I\r\nwill find them quickly, Master.\r\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no\r\ndifficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.\r\nDARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will\r\nhave revenge.\r\nDARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will\r\nbe no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is\r\ngoing as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.\r\n\r\nThe hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the\r\ncity. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY\r\n\r\nThe giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the\r\noutskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave\r\nquarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.\r\n\r\nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\nQUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift\r\ntable, having dinner as the wind howls outside.\r\nJAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a\r\nlittle brighter red.\r\n\r\nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.\r\nANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no\r\nluck.\r\nSHMI : Any attempt to escape...\r\nANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!\r\n\r\nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : How wude.\r\nPADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The\r\nRepublic's anti-slavery laws...\r\nSHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?\r\n\r\nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches\r\nsome food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.\r\nQUI-GON gives him a dirty look.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.\r\nANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.\r\n\r\nSHMI looks askance at her son.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's\r\nnever heard of a human doing it.\r\nQUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.\r\n\r\nANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl\r\nwith his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and\r\nforefinger. JAR JAR is startled.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of\r\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\r\nQUI-GON : What?\r\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\r\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\r\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\r\nANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\r\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\r\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\r\nslaves...have you come to free us?\r\nQUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...\r\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\r\n\r\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't\r\nlet anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central\r\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\r\nsecret.\r\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\r\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair\r\nit.\r\nANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!\r\nQUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we\r\nneed...\r\nJAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.\r\nPADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.\r\nSHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful\r\nraces.\r\nQUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used\r\nproperly.\r\nANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race\r\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\r\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...\r\nANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\r\nthink it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\r\n\r\nSHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto\r\nmakes you do it.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The\r\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\r\npitty bad goo.\r\nGUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\r\nmight be able to help us?\r\n\r\nSHMI shakes her head no.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\r\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\r\nSHMI : Anakin, don't...\r\n\r\nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.\r\n\r\nPADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will\r\nfind another way...\r\nSHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but\r\nhe can help you...he was meant to help you.\r\nANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!\r\n\r\nThe storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.\r\n\r\nEXT.

JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts\r\nshop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing\r\nnext to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.\r\n\r\nPADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.\r\nThe Queen will not approve.\r\nQUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.\r\nPADME : Well, I don't approve.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.\r\n\r\nINT.

How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)\r\nQUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and\r\na hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of\r\nWATTO. He studies it.\r\n\r\nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.\r\nQUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.\r\nWATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last\r\nrace. It will take some time to fix it.\r\n\r\nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his\r\nvent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.\r\nWATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.\r\nQUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever\r\nbuilt.\"\r\nWATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you\r\nsupply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings\r\nfifty-fifty, I think.\r\nQUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you\r\nfront the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus\r\nthe cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.\r\n\r\nWATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.\r\nWATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a\r\nfollish one, methinks.)\r\n\r\nEXT.

He gives without any thought of\r\nreward.\r\nSHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...\r\nQUI-GON : He has special powers.\r\nSHMI : Yes...\r\nQUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to\r\nhave such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.\r\nSHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.\r\nQUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who\r\nwas his father?\r\nSHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him\r\nbirth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?\r\nQUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have\r\nidentified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the\r\nway. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.\r\n\r\nEXT.

Stay away from those energy binders...\r\nJAR JAR : Who, mesa?\r\nANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps\r\nhim in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his\r\nmouth is numb and his words are garbled.\r\n\r\nJAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.

I've got it.\r\nQUI-GON : What are your readings?\r\nOBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.\r\nQUI-GON : Here's a signal check.\r\nOBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the\r\nreading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.\r\nQUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.\r\nOBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!\r\nQUI-GON : No Jedi has.\r\nOBI-WAN : What does it mean?\r\nQUI-GON : I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThe JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.\r\nEmbarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nEXT.

He is leading a second EOPIE\r\nbehind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he\r\nsleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,\r\nyawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.\r\nPADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and\r\nclean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as\r\nKITSTER arrives.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long.

Sitting to one side, having his\r\nshoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.\r\n\r\nWATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit\r\nto your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.\r\nQUI-GON : Why?\r\nWATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.\r\nQUI-GON : I'll take that bet.\r\nWATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!!

Just one...the\r\nmother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.\r\nQUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.\r\n\r\nWATTO shakes his head.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!\r\n\r\nWATTO shakes his head again.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.\r\nWATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or\r\nnothing.\r\nQUI-GON : The boy, then...\r\n\r\nWATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.\r\n\r\nWATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...\r\n\r\nWATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.\r\nQUI-GON smiles.

MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.\r\nANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.\r\nOne of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him\r\non one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side\r\nansd is cut off.

SEBULBA deftly\r\nveers away.\r\nANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a\r\ndune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.\r\nOne of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the\r\nwhole thing EXPLODES.\r\n\r\nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY\r\n\r\nQUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for\r\nany sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.\r\nThe crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in\r\nAnakin's defeat.\r\nThe quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The\r\nDRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all\r\ndirections, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground\r\nas SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.\r\nKITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly.

JAR JAR :\r\nWhat gooie-on?\r\nFANTA : Bug off.\r\n\r\nLap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands\r\nand YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance.

(Sixth place, not bad.)\r\n\r\nANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is\r\nunbearable.\r\nODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of\r\nthe engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out\r\nthe back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,\r\nthen EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.\r\n\r\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nA : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for\r\nsome attention.)\r\nODY : Droids!\r\n\r\nTERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off\r\nhis Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,\r\nand unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod\r\nto his engines.\r\nANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.\r\nAs the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.\r\nFinally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.\r\nSEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer\r\ncrashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of\r\ndust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the\r\ncloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.\r\n\r\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nB :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely\r\nfollowed by Skywalker...\r\n\r\nANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the\r\nrough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes\r\nthrough the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third\r\nand last lap. WATTO begins to worry.\r\nSEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.\r\nANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nB : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!\r\nA : Oh noah!\r\n\r\nOn a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.\r\n\r\nFODE BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nB : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!\r\n\r\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and\r\npushing him through the turns.\r\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\r\nkeeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake\r\nloose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is\r\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\r\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\r\nSEBULBA is able to block.\r\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\r\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final\r\nstretch of the track.\r\n\r\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nB : He's catching Sebulba.\r\nA : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)\r\n\r\nSEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN\r\nover and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering\r\nrods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.\r\n\r\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\r\nB : That little human being is out of his mind.\r\nA : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)\r\nB : They're side by side!\r\nA : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)\r\n\r\nAs they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering\r\nrods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is\r\ntremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\r\nspinning.\r\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\r\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\r\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\r\nwhat's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants\r\nare on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the\r\nEXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down\r\nwith excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle\r\nhysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile.

(to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,\r\nor what?\r\nQUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about\r\ngambling.\r\nSHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns\r\nto Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?\r\nQUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.\r\nYou are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.\r\nANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your\r\nstarship and everything?!\r\n\r\nQUI-GON kneels down to the boy.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And\r\nif you succeed, it will be a hard life.\r\nANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,\r\nMom?!\r\nQUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it\r\nis yours alone.\r\n\r\nANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.\r\n\r\nANAKIN : I want to go.\r\nQUI-GON : Then, pack your things.

You're coming, aren't\r\nyou, Mom\r\nQUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.\r\nANAKIN : But the money from selling...\r\nQUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.\r\n\r\nSHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands\r\nin hers, she draws him close.\r\n\r\nSHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let\r\ngo...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.\r\nANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.\r\nSHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from\r\nsetting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.\r\n\r\nANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a\r\nlook of concern.

ANAKIN runs into the other room.\r\n\r\nSHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.\r\nQUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word.

Although\r\nI'd like it better if I were a little less naked.\r\nANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you\r\ncoverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great\r\npal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO : Sell me?!?\r\n\r\nEXT.

You're my best friend.\r\nANAKIN : I won't forget.\r\n\r\nANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his\r\nmother standing in the doorway.

She kneels down and\r\nlooks him in the face.\r\n\r\nSHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase\r\nthe Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses\r\nseveral times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?\r\n\r\nANAKIN shakes his head.\r\n\r\nSHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something\r\nyou don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you\r\ncan do this...\r\nANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?\r\nSHMI : What does your heart tell you?\r\nANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.\r\nSHMI : Then we will see each other again.\r\nANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I\r\npromise.\r\nSHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you.

The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are\r\nbashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof\r\ndust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight.

Your Queen is\r\nlost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much\r\nsooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!\r\nBIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people\r\nhave decided... They will not live under your tyranny.\r\n\r\nBIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.\r\n\r\nOOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these\r\nrumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.\r\n\r\nINT.

There is no interest in the common good...no civility,\r\nonly politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is\r\nlittle chance the Senate will act on the invasion.\r\nAMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.\r\nPALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real\r\npower...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A\r\nmanufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.\r\nAMIDALA : What options do we have?\r\nPALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger\r\nSupreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces\r\nthe laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence\r\nin Chancellor Valorum.\r\nAMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?\r\nPALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the\r\ncourts...\r\nAMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide\r\nthings than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each\r\nday. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.\r\nPALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to\r\naccept Federation control for the time being.\r\nAMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.\r\n\r\nEXT.

CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)\r\n\r\nA large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape\r\nof Coruscant.\r\n\r\nINT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY\r\n\r\nThe Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in\r\nthe circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in\r\nthe center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo\r\ncongressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans\r\nover to the QUEEN.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,\r\nIbeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.\r\nAMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.\r\nPALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I\r\npromise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...\r\nYour Majesty, our only, chance.\r\nAMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion\r\nto a vote?\r\nPALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.\r\nVALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of\r\nNaboo.\r\n\r\nThe Naboo congressional box floats into the center.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has\r\noccured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute\r\nyou're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade\r\nroutes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the\r\nTrade Federation.\r\n\r\nA second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with\r\nFederation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.\r\n\r\nLOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!\r\nVALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade\r\nFederation at this time. Please return to your station.\r\n\r\nLOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently\r\nelected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.\r\n\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished\r\ndelegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under\r\nthe gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.\r\nInvaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the\r\nTrade...\r\nLOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a\r\ncommision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.\r\nVALORUM : Overruled.\r\nLOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without\r\nreasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.\r\n\r\nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS\r\nMOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.\r\n\r\nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate\r\nfrom the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.\r\nVALORUM : The point...\r\n\r\nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.\r\nPALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on\r\nthe payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor\r\nValorum's strength will dissapear.\r\nVALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen\r\nAmidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to\r\nexplore the validity of your accusations?\r\n\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.\r\n\r\nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve\r\nthis attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people\r\nsuffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body\r\nis not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a\r\n\"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.\r\nVALORUM : What?...No!\r\n\r\nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a\r\nroar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands\r\nspeechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.\r\n\r\nMAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...\r\n\r\nThings settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.\r\nPRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.\r\n\r\nBAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in\r\nChancellor Valorum.\r\nMAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.\r\n\r\nMAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.\r\n\r\nBAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must\r\nbe voted upon in this session.\r\nLOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures\r\ncommittee for study.\r\n\r\nThe assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.\r\n\r\nASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!\r\n\r\nPALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.\r\n\r\nPALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be\r\nvoted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong\r\nChancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...\r\nMAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will\r\nbegin the vote.\r\n\r\nThe Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.\r\n\r\nVALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend.

Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to\r\nanger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.\r\nANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!\r\nYODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

I have\r\ndecided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.\r\nPALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in\r\ndanger.

PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?\r\nAMIDALA : Ready my ship!\r\nCAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.\r\nAMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It\r\nis clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If\r\nyou win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to\r\nstop the Federation.

After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel\r\nhimself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he\r\nlistens to the JEDI.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.\r\nQUI-GON : From your point of view....\r\nOBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it.

Stay close to me and you will be safe.\r\nANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?\r\nQUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all\r\nliving cells and communicates with the Force.\r\nANAKIN : They live inside of me?\r\nQUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.\r\nANAKIN : Symbionts?\r\nQUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the\r\nmidi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the\r\nForce. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.\r\nANAKIN : They do??\r\nQUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to\r\nyou.\r\nANAKIN : I don't understand.\r\nQUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.\r\n\r\nTwo taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO\r\nTROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by\r\nQUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR.

The GUNGANS are puzzled\r\nby this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.\r\n\r\nBOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.\r\nMaybe wesa bein friends.\r\n\r\nINT.

A few hundred police and guards\r\nhave formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I\r\ncould. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much\r\nstronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\r\nPADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away\r\nfrom the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the\r\nwaterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create\r\na diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.\r\nWithout the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.\r\n\r\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.\r\n\r\nPADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?\r\nQUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.\r\nCAPT.

ANAKIN watches with\r\ninterest, as does ARTOO.\r\n\r\nPADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send\r\nwhat pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting\r\nthe planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication\r\nand their droids will be helpless.\r\nQUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons\r\non your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\r\nOBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your\r\nHighness, he will return with another droid army.\r\nPADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything\r\ndepends on it.\r\n\r\nINT.

It appears to be made up of primitives. We do\r\nnot expect much resistance.\r\nOOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.\r\nDARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be\r\nusing the Queen for their own purposes.\r\nDARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the\r\nQueen.

As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. \r\n\r\nEXT.

He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.\r\n\r\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT\r\nThe DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\nFINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tThat was wacky!

ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tSorry, I forgot you don't like\r\n\t\t\tflying, Master.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tI don't mind flying... but\r\n\t\t\twhat you're doing is suicide!\r\n\r\nThey barely miss a commuter train\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tMaster, you know I've been flying\r\n\t\t\tsince before I could walk. I'm very\r\n\t\t\tgood at this.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tJust slow down!\r\n\r\nZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tWait! Don't go in there!\r\n\r\nANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tYou know I don't like it when you\r\n\t\t\tdo that!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tSorry, Master. Don't worry, this\r\n\t\t\tguy's gonna kill himself any\r\n\t\t\tminute now!\r\n\r\nZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? He's gonna\r\n\t\t\tblast me!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tRight - this isn't working.\r\n\r\nANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tThat was too close!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tClear that!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhat??\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tClear the flag! We're losing\r\n\t\t\tpower! Hurry!\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhooooaaa! Don't do that! I\r\n\t\t\tdon't  like it when you do that!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tSo sorry, Master.\r\n\r\nThey chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tIt's dangerous near those power\r\n\t\t\tcouplings! Slow down! Don't go\r\n\t\t\tthrough there!\r\n\r\nHuge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tYiiii, what are you doing?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tSorry, Master!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastically)\r\n\t\t\tOh, that was good...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tThat was crazy!!!\r\n\r\nZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tAhh, damn.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tStop!!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tNo, we can make it.\r\n\r\nANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm\r\n\t\t\tcrazy.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tBut it worked... we made it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(angrily)\r\n\t\t\tIt didn't work... we've stalled!\r\n\t\t\tAnd you almost got us killed!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI think we're still alive.\r\n\r\nANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(very angrily)\r\n\t\t\tIt was stupid!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\t\t(sheepishly)\r\n\t\t\tI could have made it...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(furious)\r\n\t\t\tBut you didn't!!! And now we've\r\n\t\t\tlost him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tNo we didn\u0092t...\r\n\r\nOut of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhere are you going?! He went\r\n\t\t\tdown there, the other way.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tThis is a shortcut... I think.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhat do you mean, \u0091You think?\u0092\r\n\t\t\tWhat kind of shortcut?! He went\r\n\t\t\tcompletely the other way! You\u0092ve\r\n\t\t\tlost him!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tMaster, if we keep this chase\r\n\t\t\tgoing, that creep\u0092s gonna end up\r\n\t\t\tdeep fried. Personally, I\u0092d very\r\n\t\t\tmuch like to find out who in the\r\n\t\t\thell he is and who he\u0092s working\r\n\t\t\tfor...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\r\n\t\t\tOh, so that\u0092s why we\u0092re going in\r\n\t\t\tthe wrong direction.\r\n\r\nANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tWell, you lost him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI\u0092m deeply sorry, Master.\r\n\r\nANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to \r\nstart counting to himself as he watches something below approach.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tExcuse me for a moment.\r\n\r\nANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam\u0092s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter\u0092s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.\r\n\r\nZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder\u0092s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can\u0092t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN has jumped into the driver\u0092s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger\u0092s seat.\r\n\r\nANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM\u0092S hand. She grabs the Jedi\u0092s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it\u0092s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter\u0092s speeder.\r\n\r\nJust as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.\r\n\r\nEXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT\r\nZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.\r\n\r\nIt's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.\r\n\r\nANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.\r\n\r\nAhead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.\r\n\r\nA nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tAnakin!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tShe went into that club, Master.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tPatience.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t \t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tHere. Next time try not to lose it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tSorry, Master.\r\n\r\nANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tA Jedi's saber is his most\r\n\t\t\tprecious possession.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tYes, Master.\r\n\r\nHe reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tHe must keep it with him at all\r\n\t\t\ttimes.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI know, Master.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tThis weapon is your life!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI've heard this lesson before...\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tBut, you haven't learned anything,\r\n\t\t\tAnakin.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI try, Master.\r\n\r\nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT\r\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tWhy do I think you are going to be\r\n\t\t\tthe death of me?!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tDon't say that Master...

ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.\r\n\r\nCLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO\r\n\t\t\tWanna buy some death sticks?\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tYou don't want to sell me death-\r\n\t\t\tsticks.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tELAN\r\n\t\t\tI don't want to sell you death-\r\n\t\t\tsticks.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN moves his fingers.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tYou want to go home and rethink \r\n\t\t\tyour life.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tELAN\r\n\t\t\tI want to go home and rethink my\r\n\t\t\tlife.\r\n\r\nHe leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.\r\n\r\nCLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.\r\n\r\nANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.\r\n\r\nThe drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.\r\n\r\nThe room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tEasy... Official business. Go\r\n\t\t\tback to your drinks.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.\r\n\r\nEXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT\r\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN.

I wasn't the\r\n\t\t\tyoungest Queen ever elected, but\r\n\t\t\tnow that I think back on it, I'm\r\n\t\t\tnot sure I was old enough. I'm not\r\n\t\t\tsure I was ready.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tThe people you served thought you\r\n\t\t\tdid a good job. I heard they\r\n\t\t\ttried to amend the Constitution so\r\n\t\t\tyou could stay in office.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\r\n\t\t\tPopular rule is not democracy,\r\n\t\t\tAnnie. It gives the people what\r\n\t\t\tthey want, not what they need.\r\n\t\t\tAnd, truthfully, I was relieved\r\n\t\t\twhen my two terms were up. So\r\n\t\t\twere my parents. They worried\r\n\t\t\tAbout me during the blockade and\r\n\t\t\tcouldn't wait for it all to be\r\n\t\t\tover. Actually, I was hoping to\r\n\t\t\thave a family by now... My\r\n\t\t\tsisters have the most amazing,\r\n\t\t\twonderful kids... but when the\r\n\t\t\tQueen asked me to serve as\r\n\t\t\tSenator, I couldn't refuse her.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI agree! I think the Republic\r\n\t\t\tneeds you... I'm glad you chose\r\n\t\t\tto serve. I feel things are going\r\n\t\t\tto happen in our generation that\r\n\t\t\twill change the galaxy in profound\r\n\t\t\tways.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\r\n\t\t\tI think so too.\r\n\r\nANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.\r\n\r\nINT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON\r\nQUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\r\n\t\t\tWe've been worried about you.\r\n\t\t\t\t(takes her hand)\r\n\t\t\tI'm so glad you're safe, Padm\u00e9.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\r\n\t\t\tThank you, Your Highness.

And more are\r\n\t\t\tleaving the Republic every day.\r\n\t\t\tIf the Senate votes to create an\r\n\t\t\tarmy, I'm sure it's going to push\r\n\t\t\tus into a civil war.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSIO BIBBLE\r\n\t\t\tIt's unthinkable! There hasn't\r\n\t\t\tbeen a full-scale war since the\r\n\t\t\tformation of the Republic!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\r\n\t\t\tDo you see any way, through\r\n\t\t\tnegotiations, to bring the\r\n\t\t\tseparatists back into the Republic?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\r\n\t\t\tNot if they feel threatened. The\r\n\t\t\tseparatists don't have an army,\r\n\t\t\tbut if they are provoked, they\r\n\t\t\twill move to defend themselves.\r\n\t\t\tI'm sure of that. And with no time\r\n\t\t\tor money to build an army, my\r\n\t\t\tguess is they will turn to the\r\n\t\t\tCommerce Guilds or the Trade\r\n\t\t\tFederation for help.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\r\n\t\t\tThe armies of commerce!

JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY\r\nA bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.\r\n\r\nOn the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.\r\n\r\nAfter OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him.

In the\r\n\t\t\tend, I think he left because he\r\n\t\t\tlost faith in the Republic. He\r\n\t\t\tbelieved that politics were\r\n\t\t\tcorrupt, and he felt the Jedi\r\n\t\t\tbetrayed themselves by serving the\r\n\t\t\tpoliticians. He always had very\r\n\t\t\thigh expectations of government.\r\n\t\t\tHe disappeared for nine or ten\r\n\t\t\tyears, then he just showed up\r\n\t\t\trecently as the head of the\r\n\t\t\tseparatist movement.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tInteresting...

NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON\r\nPADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.\r\n\r\nBeyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs.

Always\r\n\t\t\tcarrying the weight of the\r\n\t\t\tuniverse on your shoulders.\r\n\r\nANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.\r\n\r\nANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.\r\n\r\nThe SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.\r\n\r\nANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.\r\n\r\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY\r\nOBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground.

TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY\r\nThe Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets.

He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.\r\n\r\nBelow, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.\r\n\r\nINT.

All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.\r\n\r\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY\r\nJANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship.

As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.\r\n\r\nJANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.\r\n\r\nThe bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.\r\n\r\nJANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.\r\n\r\nIN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.\r\n\r\nIN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:\r\n\r\nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.\r\n\r\nThe lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.\r\n\r\nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.\r\n\r\nJANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.\r\n\r\nLocked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.\r\n\r\nJANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:\r\n\r\nA HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.\r\n\r\nEXT.

OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.\r\n\r\nA SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING.

By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.\r\n\r\nHe cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been \r\nterribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tMom... Mom... Mom... \r\n\r\nSHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open.

He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.\r\n\r\nSLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.\r\n\r\nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN\r\nThe pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.\r\n\r\nAs she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin\u0092s lightsaber switches on.\r\n\r\nEXT.

GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\r\nThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tI was beginning to wonder if you\r\n\t\t\thad gotten my message.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI retransmitted it as you\r\n\t\t\trequested, Master.

There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSUN RIT\r\n\t\t\tThe felons before you have been\r\n\t\t\tconvicted of espionage against the\r\n\t\t\tSovereign System of Geonosis.\r\n\t\t\tTheir sentence of death is to be\r\n\t\t\tcarried out in this public arena\r\n\t\t\thenceforth.\r\n\r\nThe crowd ROARS and CHEERS.

One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.\r\n\r\nThe MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tTake the one the left. I'll\r\n\t\t\ttake the one on the right.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tWhat about Padme?\r\n\r\nPADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tIt looks like she's already on top\r\n\t\t\tof things.\r\n\r\nThe REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.\r\n\r\nThe NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.\r\n\r\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.\r\n\r\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.\r\n\r\nANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.\r\n\r\nThe NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.\r\n\r\nIn the archducal box:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\r\n\t\t\tFoul!! She can't do that... shoot\r\n\t\t\ther or something!\r\n\r\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tYou okay?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADME\r\n\t\t\t\t(nods, gasping)\r\n\t\t\tSure! Well, sort of.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tJump!!!\r\n\r\nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.\r\n\r\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\r\n\t\t\tThis isn't how it's supposed to\r\n\t\t\tbe! Jango, finish her off.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put.

The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(to Mace Windu)\r\n\t\t\tBrave, but stupid, my old Jedi\r\n\t\t\tfriend.

His smile grows.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tIt wasn't the Geonosians I was\r\n\t\t\tthinking about. How well do you\r\n\t\t\tthink one Jedi will hold up\r\n\t\t\tagainst a thousand battle droids?\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.\r\n\r\nMACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.\r\n\r\nThe REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.\r\n\r\nAmong the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.\r\n\r\nINT.

Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.\r\n\r\nANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nMACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tSomeone's got to - shut down -\r\n\t\t\tthese droids.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\r\n\t\t\tDon't worry!

He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!\r\n\r\nThere is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPLO KOON\r\n\t\t\tWe've done it! Now we have a\r\n\t\t\tchance!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKI-ADI-MUNDI\r\n\t\t\tThe system's off but they're still\r\n\t\t\tactive. That's a new feature.

GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\r\nMACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.\r\n\r\nKI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.\r\n\r\nIn the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tMaster Windu!\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tYou have fought gallantly.

You\r\n\t\t\twill have to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADME\r\n\t\t\tLook!\r\n\r\nAbove, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tYODA\r\n\t\t\tCome on - hurry! Hurry!\r\n\r\nThe SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.\r\n\r\nEXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\r\nThe massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS.

GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY\r\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.\r\n\r\nThe Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tHold on! Look over there...\r\n\r\nThrough the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tIt's Dooku, go after him!\r\n\r\nThe PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tPadme!!!\r\n\r\nANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing; to pilot)\r\n\t\t\tPut the ship down! Down!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tNo! Forget her. We have to go\r\n\t\t\tafter Dooku.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tNo we're not!!

We've got a job to\r\n\t\t\tdo.\r\n\r\nBelow, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI don't care!.. Go back.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tAnakin! She's all right!

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.\r\n\r\nCount Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.\r\n\r\nINT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY\r\nCOUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDROID CAPTAIN\r\n\t\t\tYour Excellency!\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tThat won't be necessary, Captain.\r\n\t\t\tStand down. And leave them to me.\r\n\r\nThe DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\t\t(to Anakin)\r\n\t\t\tWe move in together - you slowly\r\n\t\t\ton the...\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI'm taking him now!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tAnakin, no!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tYou'll pay for all the Jedi you've\r\n\t\t\tkilled today, Dooku.\r\n\r\nANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,\r\n\t\t\tmy Jedi powers are far beyond\r\n\t\t\tyours. Now, back down.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tI don't think so.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tAh, but if I must.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tI have spent the last ten years\r\n\t\t\tlearning to use the power of the\r\n\t\t\tDark Side. It gives me infinitely\r\n\t\t\tgreater power.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tYou will have to prove it.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tGrand Master Kenobi, you\r\n\t\t\tdisappoint me. Yoda holds you in\r\n\t\t\tsuch high esteem.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU parried another cut.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tSurely you can do better...?\r\n\t\t\t\t(parries)\r\n\t\t\tNo, I'm surprised. Has Jedi\r\n\t\t\tswordsmanship degenerated so\r\n\t\t\tquickly, or are you trying to make\r\n\t\t\tfun of me?\r\n\t\t\t\t(cuts)\r\n\t\t\tWhich is it?\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tcome, come, Master Kenobi. Put me\r\n\t\t\tout of my misery.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tThat's brave of you, boy - but\r\n\t\t\tfoolish. I would have thought\r\n\t\t\tyou'd have learnt your lesson.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tI'm a slow learner.\r\n\r\nAnd ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tYou have unusual powers, young\r\n\t\t\tPadawan. But not enought to save\r\n\t\t\tyou this time.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\r\n\t\t\tDon't bet on it!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\r\n\t\t\tAnakin!\r\n\r\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.\r\n\r\nBefore the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.\r\n\r\nSilence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\tMaster Yoda. At last we shall\r\n\t\t\tknow who is the most powerful.\r\n\r\nYODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tYODA\r\n\t\t\tCount Dooku. No interest in\r\n\t\t\tcontests, do I have.\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.\r\n\r\nYODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.\r\n\r\nCount Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tYODA\r\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\r\n\t\t\tThe end for you, Count, this is.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\r\n\t\t\t...Not yet...\r\n\r\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.\r\n\r\nANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.\r\n\r\nYODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADM\u00c9 and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\r\n\t\t\tAnakin!\r\n\r\nPADM\u00c9 runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCLONE CAPTAIN\r\n\t\t\tResistance is at an end, General.\r\n\t\t\tWhat are your orders ?\r\n\r\nYODA looks at him and sighs.\r\n\r\nEXT.

OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.\r\n\nANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.\r\n\nOBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?\r\n\nANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!\r\n\nANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!\r\n\nANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.\r\n\nANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.\r\n\nANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.\r\n\nOBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!\r\n\nOBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!\r\n\nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.\r\n\nANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .\r\n\nANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...\r\n\nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak.\r\n\nANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.\r\n\n6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.\r\n\nAhead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.\r\n\nANAKIN: Come on, Master.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?\r\n\nODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .\r\n\n7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\r\n\nODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.\r\n\nThe protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.\r\n\n8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\r\n\nANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS a worried message.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.\r\n\nFour Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.\r\n\nODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.\r\n\nANAKIN: Incoming!!\r\n\nARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Five more on the right!\r\n\nFour more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.\r\n\nANAKIN: Here we go.\r\n\nThe Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.\r\n\nANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.\r\n\nIn one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.\r\n\nARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.\r\n\nANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.\r\n\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.\r\n\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Break right and go high.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm going low and left.\r\n\nObi-Wan shakes his head.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.\r\n\nANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.\r\n\nANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: \"Survive.\"\r\n\nANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.\r\n\nOBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.\r\n\nOBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS nervously.\r\n\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.\r\n\nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, \"WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\"\r\n\nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.\r\n\nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.\r\n\nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.\r\nA CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.\r\nFinally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.\r\n\nODD BALL: There are too many of them.\r\n\nCLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!\r\n\nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.\r\n\nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .\r\n\nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan\u0092s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.\r\n\nANAKIN: They're coming around!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.\r\n\nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.\r\n\nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.\r\n\nANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!\r\n\nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.\r\n\nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?\r\n\nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.\r\n\nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .\r\n\nARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.\r\n\nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.\r\n\nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan\u0092s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...\r\n\nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.\r\n\nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.\r\n\nANAKIN: Move to the right.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.\r\n\nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.\r\n\nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.\r\n\nANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.\r\n\nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.\r\n\nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?\r\n\nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.\r\n\nANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.\r\n\n9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.\r\n\nANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.\r\nOBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.\r\n\nANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.\r\n\nANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.\r\n\nThey cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.\r\n\nANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I sense a trap.\r\n\nANAKIN: Next move?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Spring the trap.\r\n\nThe JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.\r\n\nANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.\r\n\nOBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.\r\n\n10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?\r\n\nCAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.\r\n\n11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.\r\n\nBODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.\r\n\nAs a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin. . .\r\n\nANAKIN: Ready.\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.\r\n\n12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.\r\n\nANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.\r\n\nThey run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.\r\n\nANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!\r\n\nThe last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.\r\n\nANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.\r\n\nThey move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!\r\n\nThey move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.\r\n\nThe fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.\r\n\nANAKIN: I found our escape vent.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.\r\n\nANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .\r\n\nANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a \"man-sized\" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.\r\n\n13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.\r\n\nANAKIN: Here's a way out.\r\n\nAs the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.\r\n\n14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.\r\n\n15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nA hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.\r\n\nANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.\r\n\n16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.\r\n\n17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.\r\n\n18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE\r\n\nA GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.\r\n\n19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nA large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!\r\n\nANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.\r\n\n20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.\r\n\nANAKIN: Destroyers!!\r\n\nFinally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.\r\n\nBATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.\r\n\nThe JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.\r\n\n21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nR2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.\r\n\n22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?\r\n\nANAKIN: No, did you?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: No!\r\n\nANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.\r\n\nANAKIN ignites his laser sword.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .\r\n\nANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.\r\n\n23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nTWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.\r\n\n24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo?\r\n\nANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.\r\n\nOBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.\r\n\n25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.\r\n\n26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nSuddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.\r\n\n27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe elevator starts to descend rapidly.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.\r\n\n28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nAnakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.\r\n\nDROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.\r\n\nDROID 2: Roger, roger.\r\n\n29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.\r\n\n30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!\r\n\nThe elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.\r\n\n31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!\r\n\nARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.\r\n\n32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .\r\n\n33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!\r\n\n34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.\r\n\nBefore ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .\r\n\n35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.\r\n\n36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN: What was that all about?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Did I say anything?\r\n\nANAKIN: He's trying!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!\r\n\n37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.\r\n\n38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThe elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.\r\nAt the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.\r\nAs they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.\r\n\nANAKIN: Are you all right?\r\n\nPALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.\r\n\nPALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.\r\n\nANAKIN: I was about to say that.\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.\r\n\nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.\r\n\nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.\r\n\nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.\r\nANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.\r\nANAKIN hits the archway.\r\nDOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.\r\n\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don\u0092t use them.\r\n\nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.\r\nAnakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.\r\n\n39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!\r\n\nANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: Do it!!\r\n\nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.\r\n\nANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.\r\n\nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.\r\n\nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.\r\n\nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.\r\n\nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.\r\n\nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.\r\n\nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.\r\n\nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.\r\n\nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.\r\n\nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.\r\n\n40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.\r\n\nPILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!\r\n\n41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER\r\n\nClone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.\r\n\n42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.\r\n\nANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.\r\n\nSuddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!\r\n\n43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nWindows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.\r\n\nPILOT: Reverse stabilizers.\r\n\n44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nAs the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.\r\nSeveral objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.\r\n\n45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nAs the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.\r\nANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.\r\n\n46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.\r\n\n47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nPILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!\r\n\n48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.\r\n\n49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT\r\n\nThe TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.\r\n\n50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.\r\n\nANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.\r\n\nPALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.\r\n\n51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.\r\n\nPILOT: Leveling out, sir.\r\n\n52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.\r\n\n53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.\r\n\nANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Did I miss something?\r\n\nOBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.\r\n\nANAKINN: Hold on.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: What is that?\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.\r\n\nANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!\r\n\nThey fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.\r\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.\r\n\n54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.\r\n\nANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?\r\n\n55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nAs the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.\r\n\n56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.\r\n\n57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nIt is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.\r\n\nANAKIN: I agree.\r\n\nPALPATINE: What are we going to do?\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't know.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.\r\n\nANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.\r\n\nANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.\r\n\nANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.\r\n\n58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.\r\n\n59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.\r\n\nANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.\r\n\nThey laugh.\r\n\n60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nBODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.\r\n\n61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nThey run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.\r\n\nANAKIN: Ray shields!\r\n\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.\r\n\nANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.\r\n\nANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.\r\n\nThe Jedi look at each other in disbelief.\r\n\nANAKIN: I say . . . patience.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .\r\n\nARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.\r\n\nSuddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.\r\nARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?\r\n\n62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.\r\n\nA BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.\r\n\nANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.\r\n\nANAKIN: Artoo.\r\n\nARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.\r\nOBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!\r\n\nANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.\r\n\nThe DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.\r\n\nCHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.\r\n\nOBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.\r\nOBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.\r\nANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.\r\nOBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.\r\nALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\r\n\nPILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.\r\n\nOne of the PILOTS stands next to the General.\r\n\nPILOT: The ship is breaking up!\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.\r\n\nOBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.\r\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.\r\n\n63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.\r\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.\r\n\nPALPATINE: The hull is burning up!\r\n\n64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.\r\n\n65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.\r\n\n66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE\r\n\nHe gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.\r\n\n67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.\r\n\nANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?\r\n\nANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?\r\n\nANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Well?\r\n\nANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.\r\n\nARTOO beeps.\r\n\nANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .\r\n\nA large part of the ship breaks away.\r\n\nANAKIN: We lost something.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.\r\n\nANAKIN: Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: What's our speed?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .\r\n\nANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.\r\n\nANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.\r\n\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.\r\n\nFlRESHIP PILOT: We'll take you in.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.\r\n\nANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Easy-easy.\r\n\nThe ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.\r\n\n68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON\r\n\nA large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Another happy landing.\r\n\n69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\nThe small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.\r\n\nANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.\r\n\nANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\r\n\nANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.\r\n\nANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.\r\nThe CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?\r\n\nPALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.\r\n\nPALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.\r\n\nBAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.\r\n\nANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.\r\n\nANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.\r\n\nARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.\r\n\nC-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.\r\n\nARTOO beeps.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.\r\n\n70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\nANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.\r\n\nANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.\r\n\nBehind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.\r\n\nANAKIN: Excuse me.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\r\n\nANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.\r\n\nPADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.\r\n\nANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.\r\n\nPADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.\r\n\nANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.\r\n\nPADME: Wait, not here . . .\r\n\nHe grabs her again.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.\r\n\nPADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.\r\n\nANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.\r\n\nANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?\r\n\nPADME: I'm just excited to see you.\r\n\nANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?\r\n\nPADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!\r\n\nPADME begins to cry.\r\n\nPADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?\r\n\nPADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.\r\n\nANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.\r\n\nPADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.\r\n\nANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .\r\n\nPADME: Something wonderful has happened.\r\n\nThey look at each other for a long moment.\r\n\nPADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.\r\n\nANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.\r\n\nANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.\r\n\nPADME: What are we going to do?\r\n\nANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.\r\n\n71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nA small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?\r\n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.\r\n\n72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\r\n\nA hologram of Darth Sidious appears.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.\r\n\nThe hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.\r\n\n73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT\r\n\nPADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.\r\n\nANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.\r\n\nPADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.\r\n\nANAKIN: You are so beautiful!\r\n\nPADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.\r\n\nPADME: So love has blinded you?\r\n\nANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .\r\n\nPADME: But it's probably true!\r\n\nThey laugh.\r\n\nANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .\r\n\nPADME: Neither have I.\r\n\n74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\r\n\nThe view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.\r\n\nShe screams and dies.\r\n\n75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT\r\n\nANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin??\r\n\nShe gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.\r\n\n76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT\r\n\nANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.\r\nPADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.\r\n\nPADME: What's bothering you?\r\n\nANAKIN: Nothing . . .\r\n\nANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?\r\n\nANAKIN: It was a dream.\r\n\nPADME: Bad?\r\n\nANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.\r\n\nPADME: And?\r\n\nANAKIN: It was about you.\r\n\nThey look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.\r\n\nPADME: Tell me.\r\n\nANAKIN: It was only a dream.\r\n\nPADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .\r\n\nPADME: And the baby?\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't know.\r\n\nPADME: It was only a dream.\r\n\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\r\n\nANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.\r\n\nThey embrace, then part.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.\r\n\nANAKIN: I know \u0085.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?\r\n\nANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?\r\n\nPADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.\r\n\nANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!\r\n\nPADME: I won't, Anakin.\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.\r\n\n77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY\r\n\nYODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.\r\n\nYODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .\r\n\nYODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?\r\n\nANAKIN: Someone . . .\r\n\nYODA: . . . close to you?\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes.\r\n\nYODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\r\n\nANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\r\n\nYODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.\r\n\nANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?\r\n\nYODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\r\n\n78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.\r\n\n79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\r\n\nANAKIN: What's wrong then?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\r\n\nANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\r\n\nANAKIN: Be careful of what?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.\r\n\nANAKIN: What for?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He would not say.\r\n\nANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.\r\n\nANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.\r\n\n80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?\r\n\nPALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.\r\n\nANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.\r\n\nPALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.\r\n\nANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.\r\n\nANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.\r\n\nANAKIN: Of course.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I need your help, son.\r\n\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\r\n\nPALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.\r\n\nANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.\r\n\nANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.\r\n\nPALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .\r\n\nANAKIN thinks about this.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\r\n\nANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.\r\n\n81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY\r\n\nPADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.\r\n\nFANG ZAR: When did this happen?\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.\r\n\nPADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.\r\n\nGIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.\r\n\nEVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.\r\n\nTERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.\r\n\nPADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.\r\n\nGlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .\r\n\nPADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.\r\n\nThey ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.\r\n\nPADME: Agreed.\r\n\n82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.\r\n\n83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.\r\n\nMACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.\r\n\nANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.\r\n\nYODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\r\n\nANAKIN: I understand.\r\n\nMACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.\r\n\nAnakin reacts with anger.\r\n\nANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\r\n\nMACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.\r\n\nANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.\r\n\nANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\r\n\nYODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.\r\n\nMACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.\r\n\nYODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?\r\n\nMACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\r\n\nANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.\r\n\nMACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.\r\n\nYODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.\r\n\nMACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\r\n\nANAKIN is disappointed.\r\n\n84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.\r\n\nANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\r\n\nANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\r\n\nANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.\r\n\nANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.\r\n\nANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I hope so . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\r\n\nANAKIN: And?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.\r\n\nANAKIN: What situation?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.\r\n\nANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.\r\n\nANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\r\n\nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\r\n\nANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.\r\n\n85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nA JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.\r\n\n86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY\r\n\nYODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.\r\n\nOBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\r\n\nYODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.\r\n\nMACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.\r\n\nMACE:I wish I did.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\r\n\nMACE: So the prophecy says.\r\n\nYODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.\r\n\nYODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\r\n\nThe GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.\r\n\n87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET\r\n\nPadme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.\r\n\nPADME: Thank you, Captain.\r\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.\r\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.\r\n\nPADME: I'll be up in a while.\r\n\nMOTEE: Yes, my lady.\r\n\nC-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.\r\n\nC-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?\r\n\nPADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.\r\n\nThe golden droid turns and exits.\r\n\nPADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.\r\n\nANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?\r\n\nPADME jumps and turns around.\r\n\nPADME: You startled me.\r\n\nHe sits next to her on the bench.\r\n\nANAKIN: How are you feeling?\r\n\nPADME: He keeps kicking.\r\n\nANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?\r\n\nPADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.\r\n\nShe puts his hand on her belly.\r\n\nANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.\r\n\nThey laugh.\r\n\nPADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.\r\n\nANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.\r\n\nPADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.\r\n\nANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\r\n\nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?\r\n\nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?\r\n\nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\r\n\nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!\r\n\nPADME: What is it?\r\n\nANAKIN: Nothing.\r\n\nPADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.\r\n\nANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.\r\n\nThey look in each other's eyes.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.\r\n\nPADME is startled at this.\r\n\nPADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.\r\n\nPADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.\r\n\nPADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.\r\n\n88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT\r\n\nANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.\r\nANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.\r\nANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing \"Squid Lake.\"\r\n\nANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\r\n\nANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far \u0085 but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.\r\n\nANAKIN: They try.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.\r\n\nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.\r\n\nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't think . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?\r\n\nANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.\r\n\nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?\r\n\nANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .\r\n\nANAKIN: . . . evil.\r\n\nPALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\r\n\nPALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?\r\n\nANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.\r\n\nPALPATINE smiles.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.\r\n\nANAKIN is deep in thought.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?\r\n\nANAKIN: No.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\r\n\nANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?\r\n\nPALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\r\n\nANAKIN: What happened to him?\r\n\nPALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\r\n\nANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?\r\n\nPALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.\r\n\n89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY\r\n\nA WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.\r\n\n90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\r\n\nYODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.\r\n\nMACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.\r\n\nANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.\r\n\nYODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?\r\n\nAll the JEDI concur.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\r\n\nThey all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.\r\n\nMACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.\r\n\nANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.\r\n\nYODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.\r\n\nMACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.\r\n\nANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.\r\n\nOBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.\r\n\nYODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.\r\n\nYODA: I agree.\r\n\nAll the JEDI concur.\r\n\nMACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.\r\n\nANAKIN is angry.\r\n\nMACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.\r\n\n91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\r\n\nYODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.\r\n\nYODA: Then now the time is, Commander.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.\r\n\nThe battle begins.\r\n\n92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY\r\n\nA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.\r\n\n93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING\r\n\nPadme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.\r\n\n94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING\r\n\nPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?\r\n\nPADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.\r\n\nThey laugh.\r\n\nPADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.\r\n\nPADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.\r\n\nPADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?\r\n\nOBI-WAN studies her.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.\r\n\nPADME: Don't give me that look.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.\r\n\nPADME: (nervous) What did he say?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.\r\n\nPADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.\r\n\nPADME: I don't know what you're talking about.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.\r\n\nPADME looks down and doesn't answer.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .\r\n\nThey stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .\r\n\nPADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.\r\n\n95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY\r\n\nPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.\r\n\nPADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.\r\n\nPADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.\r\n\nBANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.\r\n\nMON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.\r\n\nPADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.\r\n\nGiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.\r\n\nPADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .\r\n\nCHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.\r\n\nFANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.\r\n\nBANA BREEMU: When you present the \"petition of the two thousand\" to the Chancellor, things may change.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.\r\n\nPADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.\r\n\n96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.\r\n\nANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.\r\n\nOBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.\r\n\nANAKIN: Master!\r\n\nOBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.\r\n\nOBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.\r\n\nANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.\r\n\nOBI-WAN laughs.\r\n\nThey talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.\r\n\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.\r\n\n97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.\r\n\n98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE\r\n\nCLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?\r\n\nThey laugh.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.\r\n\nOBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you.\r\n\n99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.\r\n\n100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY\r\n\nThe Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?\r\n\nANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.\r\n\nPALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.\r\n\nANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.\r\n\nThey exit the landing platform.\r\n\n101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nThey enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.\r\n\nJAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .\r\n\nThe Gungan waves to Anakin.\r\n\nANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.\r\n\nJAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.\r\n\nAnakin turns back to the Chancellor.\r\n\nPALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.\r\n\nANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?\r\n\nPALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.\r\n\nANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?\r\n\nPALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.\r\n\nANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.\r\n\nANAKIN becomes worried.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.\r\n\n102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\r\n\nPADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\r\n\nPADME: I can't!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .\r\n\n103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.\r\n\nANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?\r\n\nPADME: He came by this morning.\r\n\nANAKIN: What did he want?\r\n\nPADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.\r\n\nPADME: He's worried about you.\r\n\nANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?\r\n\nShe continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.\r\n\nPADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.\r\n\nANAKIN: And he's not?\r\n\nPADME: You have been moody lately.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .\r\n\nPADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.\r\n\nPADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.\r\n\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.\r\n\nPADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.\r\n\nANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.\r\n\nPADME: You expect too much of yourself.\r\n\nThey stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.\r\n\nANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.\r\n\nPADME: Save me?\r\n\nANAKIN: From my nightmares.\r\n\nPADME: Is that what's bothering you?\r\n\nANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.\r\n\nPADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.\r\n\nANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.\r\n\nPADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.\r\n\nPADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.\r\n\nThey embrace and kiss.\r\n\n104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.\r\n\n105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.\r\n\nTlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.\r\n\nTlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.\r\n\nA GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan\u0092s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.\r\n\nTlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I understand.\r\n\nTlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.\r\n\nOBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.\r\n\nThe little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.\r\n\n106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY\r\n\nOn a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.\r\n\nTlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.\r\n\nBODYGUARD: What was his name?\r\n\nTlON MEDON: He didn't say.\r\n\nThey watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.\r\n\n107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.\r\n\n108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.\r\n\n109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.\r\nHe comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.\r\nOBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I need transportation.\r\n\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Get it for me.\r\n\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.\r\n\nOne of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: This one.\r\n\nThe WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.\r\n\nWRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.\r\n\nOBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.\r\n\n110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY\r\n\nThe LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.\r\n\n111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.\r\n\nOBI-WAN is deep in thought.\r\n\n112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nThe JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Hello, there!\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!\r\n\nAbout a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\r\nThey stare at each other for a moment.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.\r\n\nThe BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.\r\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Your move.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.\r\n\nHis arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!\r\n\nOBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I don't think so.\r\n\nTWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.\r\n\n113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nMore CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.\r\nThe JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.\r\n\n114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.\r\n\n115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET\r\n\nThe sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.\r\n\n116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET\r\n\nPALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.\r\n\nPADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?\r\n\nPALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .\r\n\nPADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.\r\n\nPALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.\r\n\nFANGZAR: But surely . . .\r\n\nThe Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.\r\n\nPADME: On behalf of the \"delegation of two thousand,\" I thank you, Chancellor.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.\r\n\nPADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.\r\n\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\r\n\nPALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.\r\n\nANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.\r\n\nANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.\r\n\nPALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.\r\n\n117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nKI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we\r\nhave begun our attack.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his\r\nintentions.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\r\n\nANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.\r\n\nMACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from\r\noffice.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .\r\n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.\r\n\nYODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.\r\n\n118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.\r\n\nANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.\r\n\nPALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.\r\n\nANAKIN: I should be there with him.\r\n\nPALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?\r\n\nANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\r\n\nPALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\r\n\nThey walk into the hallway.\r\n\nANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?\r\n\nPALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.\r\n\nThey stop.\r\n\nANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?\r\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.\r\n\nANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\r\n\nANAKIN: What did you say?\r\n\nPALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!\r\n\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.\r\n\nANAKIN: You're wrong!\r\n\nPALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?\r\n\nANAKIN: I would certainly like to.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.\r\n\nANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.\r\n\nANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?\r\n\nANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\r\n\nPALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.\r\n\nANAKIN stares at him for a moment.\r\nPALPATINE turns and moves to his office.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE sits behind his desk.\r\n\n119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.\r\n\n120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY\r\n\nA LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.\r\n\n121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.\r\n\nOBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\r\n\nThe GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.\r\n\n122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.\r\n\n123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nExtending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.\r\n\nOBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.\r\n\nOBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.\r\n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.\r\n\nThe JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.\r\n\n124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nMACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.\r\n\nANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\r\n\nANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.\r\n\nMACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: How do you know this?\r\n\nANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: Are you sure?\r\n\nANAKIN: Absolutely.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.\r\n\nANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.\r\n\nANAKIN: I must go, Master.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\r\n\nMACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\r\n\nANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.\r\n\n125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING\r\n\n(INTERCUT)\r\n\nPADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.\r\n\nPADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.\r\n\nC-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?\r\n\nANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die.\r\n\nANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.\r\n\n126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nThe sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.\r\nFOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.\r\n\n127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nThe FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office.\r\n\n128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\u0092S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\r\n\nMACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.\r\n\nMACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.\r\n\nMACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?\r\n\nMACE: The Senate will decide your fate.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!\r\n\nMACE: Not yet!\r\n\nPALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.\r\n\nPALPATINE: It's treason, then.\r\n\nA close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.\r\n\nJedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.\r\n\nANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.\r\n\nIn the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.\r\n\nThey stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.\r\n\nMACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: No! No! You will die!\r\n\nPALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.\r\n\nPALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: He's the traitor. Stop him!\r\n\nPALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: Don't listen to him, Anakin.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .\r\n\nMACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.\r\n\nANAKIN: You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.\r\n\nMACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.\r\n\nANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .\r\n\nMACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: Please don't, please don't . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: I need him . . .\r\n\nPALPATINE: Please don't . . .\r\n\nANAKIN: NO!!!\r\n\nJust as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.\r\n\nAs MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.\r\nThe full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!\r\n\nHis face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.\r\n\nANAKIN: What have I done?\r\n\nANAKIN sits.\r\n\nPALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.\r\n\nANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Good.\r\n\nANAKIN: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.\r\n\nPALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.\r\n\nANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.\r\n\nANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.\r\n\nANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.\r\n\nPalpatine moves over to his desk.\r\n\n129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\r\n\nYODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.\r\n\n130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING\r\n\nPALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.\r\n\nANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?\r\n\nANAKIN: I understand, Master.\r\n\nPALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.\r\n\nANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?\r\n\nPALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.\r\n\n131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT\r\n\nANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.\r\n\n132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.\r\n\nHe hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!\r\n\nOBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.\r\nThe battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.\r\n\nThe HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!\r\n\nThe battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.\r\nOBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.\r\n\n133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN\r\n\nThe sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.\r\n\n134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY\r\n\nA column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.\r\n\nAAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .\r\n\nThey all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.\r\n\nAAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?\r\n\nBLY: No.\r\n\nBLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.\r\n\nAnother Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.\r\n\n135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\r\n\nYODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.\r\n\n136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY\r\n\nThe battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.\r\n\nThe Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.\r\nThe cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.\r\n\n137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY\r\n\nThe CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Execute Order Sixty-Six.\r\n\nCLONE PILOT: It will be done, My Lord.\r\n\n138 INT.

CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-NIGHT\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord.\r\n\nDABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\r\n\n142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY\r\n\nA vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.\r\n\nYODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.\r\n\nBut faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.\r\n\n143 EXT.

CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT\r\n\nANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.\r\n\nYOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?\r\n\nANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\n146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nC-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.\r\n\nC-3PO: The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.\r\n\nPADME bursts into tears.\r\n\n147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nThe city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.\r\n\n148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nThe Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: What's going on here?!?\r\n\nCLONE SERGEANT: There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.\r\n\nThe CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.\r\n\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.\r\n\nThe CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.\r\n\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: And so it is.\r\n\nBAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!\r\n\nSEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser\r\npistol.\r\n\nThe YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.\r\n\nThe Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.\r\n\n149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.\r\n\n150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY\r\n\nThe Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.\r\n\n151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.\r\n\nOBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.\r\n\nThe NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.\r\n\nThe SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.\r\n\n152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK\r\n\nCLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.\r\n\nAT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!\r\n\nA CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.\r\n\nCREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)\r\n\nCLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?\r\n\nCREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)\r\n\nCLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.\r\n\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\r\n\nSuddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.\r\n\nCREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.\r\n\nTARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.\r\n\nYODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.\r\n\nYODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.\r\n\nYODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .\r\n\nYODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.\r\n\n153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK\r\n\nThe AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.\r\nThe ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.\r\n\nYODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.\r\n\nThe Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.\r\n\n154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.\r\n\nROYAL GUARD: Identification . . .\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.\r\n\nBAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.\r\n\n155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.\r\n\n156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?\r\n\nCAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.\r\n\n157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.\r\n\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?\r\n\nCLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.\r\n\nHe watches them pass.\r\n\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.\r\n\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\r\n\nOBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.\r\n\n158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.\r\n\n159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter.\r\n\n160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .\r\n\nA BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.\r\n\nBAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.\r\n\nThe FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.\r\n\n161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\u0092SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nPADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.\r\n\nC-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.\r\n\nPADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.\r\n\n162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN\r\n\nTHREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.\r\n\nTHREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!\r\n\nPADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.\r\n\nPADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.\r\n\nANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.\r\n\nPADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?\r\n\nC-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.\r\n\nC-3PO: What is going on?\r\n\nARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.\r\n\nANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .\r\n\nPADME: I can't believe that!\r\n\nANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.\r\n\nC-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.\r\n\nC-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS quietly.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?\r\n\nANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.\r\n\nANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.\r\n\nANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.\r\n\nPADME: What about Obi-Wan?\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.\r\n\nPADME: How could this have happened?\r\n\nANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.\r\n\nPADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.\r\n\nPADME: What are you saying?\r\n\nANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.\r\n\nPADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?\r\n\nANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.\r\n\nPADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.\r\n\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\r\n\nANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.\r\n\nThey kiss.\r\n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.\r\n\nPADME: I will.\r\n\nANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.\r\n\nC-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.\r\n\nARTOO beeps.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.\r\n\nARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.\r\n\nC-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?\r\n\nPADME: No thank you, Threepio.\r\n\nG-3PO: A snack, perhaps?\r\n\nPADME: No.\r\n\nTHREEPIO starts to move off.\r\n\nC-3PO: I feel so helpless.\r\n\n163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE\r\n\nOBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser.\r\n\n164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nThe door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: You made it.\r\n\nYODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?\r\n\nYODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?\r\n\nYODA: Heard from no one, have we.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?\r\n\nYODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return.\r\n\nYODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.\r\n\nYODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.\r\n\n165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY\r\n\nWorkers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.\r\n\n166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nA HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.\r\n\nThe hologram disappears.\r\n\n167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT\r\n\nThe Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.\r\n\nPILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Send it through.\r\n\nPILOT: Yes, sir.\r\n\nThe PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.\r\n\nYODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.\r\n\n168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.\r\n\nGUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\r\n\nGUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.\r\n\nGUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.\r\n\nBAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.\r\n\n169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE\r\n\nANAKIN's Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.\r\n\n170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.\r\n\nANAKIN: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.\r\n\nARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.\r\n\n171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.\r\n\n172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.\r\n\nEveryone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.\r\n\n173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY\r\n\nSmoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.\r\n\n174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY\r\n\nA DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.\r\n\nYODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.\r\n\n175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET\r\n\nThe awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.\r\n\n176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\r\n\nThe Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.\r\n\nPALPATINE: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: I was held up. What's happening?\r\n\nPADME: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: That's not true!\r\n\nPADME: He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.\r\n\nPALPATINE: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.\r\n\n(applause)\r\n\nThese have been trying times, but we have passed the test.\r\n\n177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET\r\n\nYODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.\r\nYODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Not even the younglings survived.\r\n\nYODA: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?\r\n\n178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.\r\n\nANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.\r\n\nThen POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.\r\n\n179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\r\n\nPALPATINE: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.\r\n\nApplause.\r\n\n180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nIn the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.\r\n\n181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\r\n\nPALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.\r\n\nPALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.\r\n\nThere is a long period of APPLAUSE.\r\n\nPADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.\r\n\nPALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.\r\n\nThere is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .\r\n\nThe Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .\r\n\nThe Senate APPLAUDS.\r\n\nPADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen.\r\n\nHe starts to stand up. PADME stops him.\r\n\nPADME: Not now! There will be a time.\r\n\n182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY\r\n\nAfter everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.\r\n\nRUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!\r\n\nRUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.\r\n\n183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .\r\n\nNUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.\r\n\n184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT\r\n\nOBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.\r\n\nYODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.\r\n\n185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT\r\n\nOBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .\r\n\nYODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master.\r\n\nOBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .\r\n\nAs ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.\r\n\nANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?\r\n\nANAKIN: Yes, My Master.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.\r\n\nOBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I can't watch any more.\r\n\nOBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.\r\n\nYODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.\r\n\nYODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.\r\n\nYODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?\r\n\nYODA: To question, no time there is.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.\r\n\nYODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.\r\n\n186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON\r\n\nA DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment.\r\n\n187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON\r\n\nThe cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.\r\n\nC-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.\r\n\nThe security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?\r\n\nC-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.\r\n\nPADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.\r\n\nPADME: Master Kenobi . . .\r\n\nShe embraces Obi-Wan.\r\n\nPADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .\r\n\nPADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.\r\n\nPADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.\r\n\nPADME: The Sith!?!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?\r\n\nPADME: Yesterday.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?\r\n\nPADME: (looks down) No.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.\r\n\nPADME: From the Sith?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.\r\n\nPADME: You're wrong! How could you even say that?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.\r\n\nPADME: Not Anakin! He couldn't!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.\r\n\nPADME: I don't believe you ... I can't.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.\r\n\nPADME: You're going to kill him, aren't you?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.\r\n\nAs PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.\r\n\nPADME: I can't . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn't he?\r\n\nPADME looks away.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm so sorry.\r\n\nOBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.\r\n\n188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nR2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter.\r\n\n189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN surveys the slaughter with a crazed look in his eyes.\r\n\n190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony.\r\n\n191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET\r\n\nA small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.\r\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.\r\n\nPADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.\r\n\nTYPHO bows.\r\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.\r\n\nPADME: I'll be all right, Captain.\r\n\nHe goes to the speeder and gets in.\r\n\nPADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.\r\n\nC-3PO: Oh, dear.\r\n\nTYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.\r\n\n192 INT. NABOO SKIFF\r\n\nTHREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.\r\n\nC-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.\r\n\nOBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.\r\n\n193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET\r\n\nA HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master.\r\n\n194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY\r\n\nA Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.\r\n\nANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.\r\n\n195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.\r\n\nANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .\r\n\nThey embrace.\r\n\nPADME: Oh, Anakin!\r\n\nANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?\r\n\nPADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.\r\n\nANAKIN: What things?\r\n\nPADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.\r\n\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.\r\n\nPADME: He cares about us.\r\n\nANAKIN: Us??!\r\n\nPADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.\r\n\nANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.\r\n\nPADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.\r\n\nANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.\r\n\nPADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.\r\n\nANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.\r\n\nPADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.\r\n\nANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.\r\n\nPADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.\r\n\nANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.\r\n\nPADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I\r\ncan't follow.\r\n\nANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?\r\n\nPADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.\r\n\nANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!\r\n\nPADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.\r\n\nPADME: No!\r\n\nANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!\r\n\nPADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...\r\n\nANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.\r\n\nANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Let her go!\r\n\nANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.\r\n\nANAKIN: You turned her against me.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.\r\n\nANAKIN: You will not take her from me.\r\n\nANAKIN throws off his cloak.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.\r\n\nOBI-WAN flings off his cloak.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.\r\n\nThey circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.\r\n\nANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Your new Empire?\r\n\nANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.\r\n\nANAKIN: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.\r\n\n(ignites his lightsaber)\r\n\nANAKIN: You will try.\r\n\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\nANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.\r\nThey work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.\r\nARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.\r\n\n196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT\r\n\nYODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.\r\n\nYODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.\r\n\nYODA: Surprised?\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.\r\n\nThe Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.\r\nYODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.\r\n\n197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.\r\n\n198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY\r\n\nR2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship's doorway.\r\n\nC-3PO: What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!\r\n\nC-3PO starts down the ramp.\r\n\n199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.\r\n\nYODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.\r\n\nYODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.\r\n\nYODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.\r\n\nYODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??\r\n\nYODA ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\nDARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.\r\n\nYODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.\r\n\nTheir swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.\r\n\n\n200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nView screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.\r\n\nANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.\r\n\nANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN\u0092s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.\r\n\n201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\r\n\nPALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor's Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.\r\n\n202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\r\n\nThe battle intensifies.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.\r\n\nOBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.\r\n\nANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.\r\nBoth combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.\r\nThey regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.\r\nThey battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.\r\n\n203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\r\n\nYODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.\r\n\nThe energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.\r\n\nYODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.\r\n\nYODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.\r\n\nYODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.\r\n\nYODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.\r\n\n204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.\r\n\nThe balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.\r\n\nANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.\r\nALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.\r\n\n205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.\r\n\n206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.\r\n\n207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT\r\n\nYODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.\r\n\nYODA: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: (in speeder) There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.\r\n\n208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\r\n\nA Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.\r\n\nPALPATINE: Double your search.\r\n\nCLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.\r\n\nPALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.\r\n\nMAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.\r\n\nPALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.\r\n\nPALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.\r\n\n209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.\r\nSupport for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.\r\n\nIt bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.\r\n\n210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.\r\n\n211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S SPEEDER-NIGHT\r\n\nYODA straightens himself out.\r\n\nYODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.\r\n\nYODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.\r\n\n212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.\r\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.\r\n\n213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\r\n\nC-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.\r\n\nC-3PO: I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.\r\n\nC-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.\r\n\n214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\r\n\nFrom their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.\r\n\nSNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.\r\n\nOBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.\r\n\nANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.\r\n\nOBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.\r\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.\r\n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.\r\n\nANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .\r\n\nOBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.\r\n\nANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!\r\n\nANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.\r\n\nANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.\r\n\nANAKIN: You underestimate my power!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Don't try it.\r\n\nANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.\r\n\nANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.\r\n\nOBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.\r\n\nANAKIN: I hate you!\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.\r\n\nANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.\r\n\n215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.\r\n\nHe runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.\r\n\n216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\r\n\nOBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.\r\n\nC-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.\r\n\nOBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.\r\n\n217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\r\n\nPADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.\r\n\nPADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?\r\n\nOBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.\r\nOBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.\r\n\n218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.\r\n\n219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY\r\n\nAn Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS.\r\n\n220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.\r\n\n221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.\r\n\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.\r\n\nSeveral of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.\r\n\n222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT\r\n\nOn the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.\r\n\nYODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...\r\n\nQUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.\r\n\nYODA: Eternal consciousness.\r\n\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.\r\n\nYODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.\r\n\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.\r\n\nYODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.\r\n\nYODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.\r\n\n223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\r\n\nThe CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.\r\n\n224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT\r\n\nOBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.\r\n\n225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\r\n\nThe shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN's body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.\r\n\n226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\r\n\nPOLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: She's dying?\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.\r\n\nYODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.\r\n\nThe MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.\r\n\nC-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.\r\n\n227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\r\n\nANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.\r\n\n228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\r\n\nThe TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme.\r\n\nPADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: It's a boy.\r\n\nPADME: Luke . . .\r\n\nPADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.\r\n\nPADME: . . . Leia.\r\n\nR2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.\r\n\n229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\r\n\nVADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.\r\n\n230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\r\n\nOBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.\r\n\nPADME: I can't . . .\r\n\nPADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\r\n\nPADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .\r\n\nA last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.\r\n\n231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.\r\n\nMEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.\r\n\nThe DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?\r\n\nDARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.\r\n\nDARTH VADER looks around the room.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.\r\n\nDARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.\r\n\nA LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.\r\n\nDARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!\r\n\nVADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.\r\n\n232 EXT.

ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA, YODA, and OBI-WAN sit around a conference table.\r\n\nYODA: Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.\r\n\nYODA: Split up, they should be.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: And what of the boy?\r\n\nYODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?\r\n\nYODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.\r\n\nBAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.\r\n\nYODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Training??\r\n\nYODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Who?\r\n\nYODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?\r\n\nYODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.\r\n\nOBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?\r\n\nYODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.\r\n\n234 INT. ALDERAAN STARCRUISER-HALLWAY- SPACE\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: Captain Antilles.\r\n\nCAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, Your Highness.\r\n\nBAIL ORGANA: I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.\r\n\nC-3PO: Oh, no.\r\n\n235 EXT.

He dismounts, takes the BABY out of a papoose on his back, and walks toward AUNT BERU, who walks over to greet him. They talk for a moment, and OBI-WAN turns the baby over to the young homesteader. AUNT BERU walks to UNCLE OWEN who is standing on the ridge near the homestead. OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN, BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set.\r\n\nIRIS OUT.

Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE \r\nhas secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even \r\nmore powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this \r\nultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels \r\nstruggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\r\n\r\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive \r\nsuperstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of \r\na giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, \r\ngreen moon of ENDOR.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored \r\nspace station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial \r\nshuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the \r\nDeath Star.\r\n\r\n2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT \r\nThe shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.\r\n\r\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\r\nCommand station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting \r\nour approach.

You are clear to \r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\r\nWe're starting our approach.\r\n\r\n3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits \r\nswitches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death \r\nStar, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible \r\ndeflector shield.\r\n\r\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\r\n\r\nOFFICER\r\nInform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\r\n\r\nOPERATOR\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial \r\nshuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial \r\nstormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\r\n\r\n4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, \r\nstrides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. \r\nThe troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. \r\nBut the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.\r\n\r\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only \r\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this \r\nblack void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the \r\nassemblage as he walks down the ramp.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nLord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your \r\npresence.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you \r\nback on\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nI assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nPerhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nI tell you, this station will be operational as planned.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nBut he asks the impossible. I need more men.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThen perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\t (aghast)\r\nThe Emperor's coming here?\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThat is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your \r\napparent lack of progress.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nWe shall double our efforts.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nI hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as \r\nI am.\r\n\r\n5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE\r\n\r\nA lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine \r\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before \r\ncatching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along \r\nthe road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and \r\npoor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles timidly.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this \r\nJabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.\r\n\r\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.\r\n\r\n6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE \r\n\r\nThreepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly \r\nknocks on the iron door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (instantly) \r\nThere doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master \r\nLuke.\r\n\r\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical \r\narm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects \r\nthe two droids.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE VOICE\r\nTee chuta hhat yudd!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGoodness gracious me!\r\n\r\n Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\r\n\r\n THREEPIO\r\n Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\r\n\r\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the \r\neye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his \r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.\r\n\r\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the \r\nmassive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The \r\nrobots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at \r\none another, afraid to enter.\r\n\r\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby \r\ncompanion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO \r\nArtoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should \r\nrush into all this.\r\n\r\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!\r\n\r\n7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY\r\n\r\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark \r\npassageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN \r\nGUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the \r\ntwo lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. \r\nArtoo beeps nervously.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! \r\nOh! Oh, no.\r\n\r\nWalking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike \r\nalien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nDie Wanna Wanga!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, \r\nJabba the Hutt.\r\n\r\nArtoo lets out a series of quick beeps.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (cont)\r\n...and a gift.\r\n(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)\r\nGift, what gift?\r\n\r\nBib shakes his head negatively.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nNee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\r\n\r\nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, \r\nletting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the \r\nstrange-looking alien.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.\r\n\r\nBib thinks about this for a moment.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort \r\nof things.\r\n\r\nBib gestures for the droids to follow.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nNudd Chaa.\r\n\r\nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed \r\nby the two guards.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, I have a bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\n8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES \r\never conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as \r\nthey pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts \r\npartially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the \r\nroom to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating \r\ncrowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a \r\nrepulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the \r\nhorrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At \r\nthe foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS \r\nCRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba \r\nlaughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows \r\npolitely.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGood morning.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBo Shuda!\r\n\r\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned \r\nvillain.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nThe message, Artoo, the message.\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, \r\ncreating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten \r\nfeet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke \r\nSkywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are \r\npowerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally \r\npowerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's \r\nlife. \r\n(Jabba's crowd laughs) \r\nWith your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which \r\nwill be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant \r\nconfrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: \r\nthese two droids.\r\n\r\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWhat did he say?\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (cont)\r\n... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.\r\n\r\nLuke's hologram disappears.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThere will be no bargain.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWe're doomed.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he \r\nis.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. \r\nHanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a \r\ncarbonized HAN SOLO.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\r\n\r\n9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR \r\n\r\nOne of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, \r\nshadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable \r\ncreatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm \r\nor tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps \r\npitifully.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? \r\nHe never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\r\n\r\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break \r\nfree, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.\r\n\r\n10   INT BOILER ROOM\r\n\r\nThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy \r\nmachinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are \r\nmet by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can \r\nbe seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work \r\ndroid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons \r\nare pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized \r\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-\r\n9D9.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI am See-Threepio, human-cy...\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nYes or no will do.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh. Well, yes.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nHow many languages do you speak?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can \r\nreadily...\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nSplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got \r\nangry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDisintegrated?\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\t (to a Gamorrean guard)\r\nGuard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining \r\nbolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\r\n\r\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (disappearing)\r\nArtoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!\r\n\r\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps \r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have \r\nneed for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in \r\nnicely.\r\n\r\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured \r\nelectronic scream.\r\n\r\n11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous \r\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a \r\nfat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.\r\n\r\nJabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons \r\nOola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, \r\nshaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nDa Eitha!\r\n\r\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\r\n\r\nOOLA\r\nNa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\r\n\r\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBoscka!\r\n\r\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the \r\nfloor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a \r\nmuffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous \r\nfriends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her \r\nfate through a grate.\r\n\r\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han \r\nSolo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.\u00caAn \r\nunnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the \r\nroom, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two \r\nguards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his \r\ncaptive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\r\n\r\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into \r\nhis ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens \r\nintently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a \r\ngreeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\r\nI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, no! Chewbacca!\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\r\n\r\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to \r\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!\r\n\r\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh \r\nlistens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices \r\nBOBA FETT standing near the door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the \r\nreward of twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\r\nI want fifty thousand. No less.\r\n\r\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the \r\nraised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his \r\nweapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the \r\nthrone. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nUh, oh... but what, what did I say?\r\n(to Boushh)\r\nUh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio \r\nlooks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The \r\ndroid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.\r\n\r\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the \r\nroom. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the \r\nbounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba \r\nstares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across \r\nhis vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThis bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\r\n\r\nJabba continues.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\r\n\r\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his \r\nreaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes \r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nZeebuss.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe agrees!\r\n\r\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and \r\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca \r\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a \r\nskiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing \r\ngirls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly \r\nappreciative creatures.\r\n\r\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the \r\nscene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across \r\nthe room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling \r\nhis weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\r\n\r\n12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL\r\n\r\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When \r\na tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes \r\nagainst the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. \r\nIt takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming \r\nthe door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the \r\niron door.\r\n\r\n13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE\r\n\r\nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in \r\nfront, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert \r\nrodent and burps in satisfaction.\r\n\r\n14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien \r\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several \r\ndrunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.\r\n\r\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of \r\nthe room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his \r\nway carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.\r\n\r\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his \r\ncoffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter \r\ndeactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of \r\nthe coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\r\n\r\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the \r\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches \r\nand, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization \r\nlever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the \r\ncontours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches \r\nas Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, \r\npreviously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His \r\nface muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\r\n\r\nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath \r\nof life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he \r\nbegins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\r\n\r\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nShhh. You have hibernation sickness.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI can't see.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nYour eyesight will return in time.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhere am I?\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nJabba's palace.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWho are you?\r\n\r\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, \r\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nSomeone who loves you.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLeia!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI gotta get you out of here.\r\n\r\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is \r\npierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat's that? I know that laugh.\r\n\r\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the \r\nHutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his \r\ngross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I \r\ngot a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nIt's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but \r\nnow you're Bantha fodder.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLook...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)\r\nTake him away!\r\n\r\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. \r\nDon't be a fool!\r\n\r\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead \r\nLeia away.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nBring her to me.\r\n\r\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young \r\nprincess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly \r\nturns away in disgust.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI'm sure.\r\n\r\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly \r\nblob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nUgh!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOhhh, I can't bear to watch.\r\n\r\n15   INT DUNGEON CELL\r\n\r\nThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A \r\nguard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door \r\nslams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack \r\nin the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is \r\nheard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell \r\ndoor and listens.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie? Chewie, is that you?\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting \r\nhim off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, \r\nrevealing Chewie.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAh! Chew--Chewie!\r\n\r\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?\r\n\r\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less \r\nrescue anybody.\r\n\r\nChewie barks a reply.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets \r\ndelusions of grandeur.\r\n\r\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.\r\n\r\n16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE\r\n\r\nNoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT \r\nand reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a \r\nrobe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke \r\nstrides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block \r\nLuke's path. Luke halts.\r\n\r\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately \r\nlower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and \r\nmoves on down the hallway.\r\n\r\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they \r\napproach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his \r\ndirection and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the \r\nconversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI must speak with Jabba.\r\n\r\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and \r\nstares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou will take me to Jabba now!\r\n\r\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him \r\ninto the gloom.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou serve your master well.\r\n\r\nBib responds.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nAnd you will be rewarded.\r\n\r\n17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. \r\nSalacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now \r\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a \r\nmanacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. \r\nThreepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\n...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI told you not to admit him.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI must be allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nHe must be allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nYou weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\r\n\r\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nYour mind powers will not work on me, boy.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either \r\nprofit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not \r\nto underestimate my powers.\r\n\r\nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about \r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nMaster Luke, you're standing on...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThere will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\r\n\r\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies \r\ninto Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his \r\nhand.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBascka!\r\n\r\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into \r\nthe pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba \r\nlaughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained \r\nby a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at \r\nhim and he shakes his head \"no.\"\r\n\r\n18   INT RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the \r\ndungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically \r\nfor help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in \r\nthe side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. \r\nLuke looks calmly around for a means of escape.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, no! The Rancor!\r\n\r\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged \r\nRANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries \r\nfutilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.\r\n\r\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the \r\nRancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few \r\nscreams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers \r\nand laughs at the guard's fate.\r\n\r\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just \r\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of \r\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his \r\nsalivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the \r\nmonster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in \r\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an \r\navalanche.\r\n\r\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes \r\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the \r\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility \r\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into \r\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it \r\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\r\n\r\n19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding \r\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he \r\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond \r\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the \r\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The \r\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, \r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for \r\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. \r\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the \r\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes \r\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on \r\nan egg.\r\n\r\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation \r\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning \r\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh \r\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\r\n\r\n21   INT RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead \r\nbeast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly \r\nat Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel \r\nand take Luke away.\r\n\r\n22   INT THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into \r\nthe throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHan!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nAre you all right?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nFine. Together again, huh?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWouldn't miss it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHow are we doing?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThe same as always.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?\r\n\r\nLuke looks to Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'm here.\r\n\r\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia \r\nlike a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from \r\nthe other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.\r\n\r\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed \r\nthat you are to be terminated immediately.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood, I hate long waits.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of \r\nCarkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (to Luke)\r\nDoesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as \r\nyou are slowly digested over a thousand years.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\r\n\r\nChewie barks his agreement.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever \r\nmake.\r\n\r\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\r\n\r\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer \r\nrises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but \r\nLuke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.\r\n\r\n23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF\r\n\r\nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by \r\ntwo smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, \r\nHan, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is \r\nLando in disguise.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a \r\nbig light blur.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nOh... great!\r\n\r\n24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His \r\nentire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. \r\nLeia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to \r\nher neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to \r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nSoon you will learn to appreciate me.\r\n\r\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller \r\ndroid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby \r\ndroid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\r\n\r\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. \r\nThey're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHmm.  I wish I had your confidence.\r\n\r\n25   EXT SARLACC PIT \r\n\r\nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one \r\nside of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's \r\nskiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of \r\nthe deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by \r\nthousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is \r\nextended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's \r\nbonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.\r\n\r\n26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward \r\nand the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps \r\nup to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of \r\nintergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across \r\nloudspeakers.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die \r\nhonorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba \r\nthe Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\r\n\r\n27   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get \r\nno such pleasure from us. Right?\r\n\r\nChewie growls his agreement.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\r\n\r\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look \r\nof conspiracy to him.\r\n\r\n28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips \r\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as \r\nhe speaks into the comlink.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nMove him into position.\r\n\r\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\r\n\r\n29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK\r\n\r\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. \r\nBelow, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the \r\nplank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a \r\njaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap \r\nopens in Artoo's domed head.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nPut him in.\r\n\r\n30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK\r\n\r\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the \r\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is \r\nhappening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his \r\nfingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him \r\nskyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of \r\nthe plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He \r\ncasually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has \r\nsent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.\r\n\r\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded \r\nhim off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The \r\nother guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber \r\nflashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.\r\n\r\n31   EXT SARLACC PIT\r\n\r\nA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and \r\nbegins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him \r\nand pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.\r\n\r\n32   INT SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the \r\nguards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures \r\nwatching the action from the window are in an uproar.\r\n\r\n33   EXT SKIFF \r\n\r\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of \r\nthe Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nEasy, Chewie.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts \r\nfrom a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of \r\nthe rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately \r\nabove the Sarlacc pit.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWhoa! Whoa! Help!\r\n\r\n34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket \r\npack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.\r\n\r\n35   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who \r\nhas freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, \r\nthe young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty \r\nhunter's gun in half.\r\n\r\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck \r\ngun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the \r\nrail.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie, you okay? Where is he?\r\n\r\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm okay, pal.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a \r\ncable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong \r\ncable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from \r\nthe wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight \r\nup to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable \r\nand stands free.\r\n\r\nAnother blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is \r\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHan! Chewie?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLando!\r\n\r\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets \r\nhim. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves \r\nin on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young \r\nJedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating \r\nthe guards from their midst.\r\n\r\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, \r\nguiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. \r\nHan searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold \r\nof the spear.\r\n\r\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the \r\nother skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his \r\narm, and aims his lethal appendage.\r\n\r\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\r\n\r\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand \r\nwhacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts \r\noff, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the \r\nside of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams \r\nas his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into \r\nthe mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a \r\nweak congratulations to Han.\r\n\r\n36   INT SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and \r\nthrows the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous \r\nneck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the \r\nchain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath \r\nthe tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his \r\nscum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms \r\nthrough its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia \r\nstruggles to free herself of her bondage.\r\n\r\n37   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han \r\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously \r\nfrom a rope on the prisoner's skiff.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLando, grab it!\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nLower it!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm trying!\r\n\r\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han \r\nand almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, \r\nand Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot \r\ncatches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. \r\nThe wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit \r\nfrom the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.\r\n\r\nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han \r\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the \r\npit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!\r\n\r\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck \r\ngun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the \r\nskiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail \r\nBarge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up \r\nthe hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his \r\nhead. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks \r\nthe helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.\r\n\r\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who \r\nis in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron \r\nhas stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by \r\nlying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand \r\nmoves him closer to his final reward.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!\r\n\r\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let \r\ngo of the spear.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHold it! Whoa!\r\n\r\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.\r\n\r\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly \r\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nNo, wait! I thought you were blind!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\r\n\r\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate \r\nfires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and \r\nChewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!\r\n\r\n38   EXT UPPER DECK\r\n\r\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in \r\ntheir gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: \r\nLuke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. \r\nThe deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young \r\nJedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more \r\ngunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) \r\nracing for him, firing their laser pistols.\r\n\r\n39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips \r\nthrough the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby \r\nlittle droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCome on. We gotta get out of here quick.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and \r\nscreaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out \r\none of the golden droid's eyes.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nNot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!\r\n\r\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, \r\ncrashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye \r\ndangling from a wire) hurry off.\r\n\r\n40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by \r\nguards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke \r\nturns to face another guard.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (to Leia)\r\nGet the gun! Point it at the deck!\r\n\r\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels \r\nthe gun around.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nPoint it at the deck!\r\n\r\nA laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, \r\nbut manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the \r\nguards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He \r\nflexes the hand; it still works.\r\n\r\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves \r\nas Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.\r\n\r\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, \r\ntumbling toward the sand.\r\n\r\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she \r\nhas brought around to point down at the deck.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome on!\r\n\r\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers \r\nLeia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun \r\nexplodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.\r\n\r\n41   EXT SKIFF  \r\n\r\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. \r\nLuke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLet's go! And don't forget the droids.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe're on our way.\r\n\r\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge \r\ncraft is on fire.\r\n\r\n42   EXT SAND DUNE\r\n\r\nThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next \r\nto it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff \r\nfloats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. \r\nWith a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled \r\nfrom the sand.\r\n\r\n43   EXT DUNE SEA\r\n\r\nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues \r\nits chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the \r\nbarge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.\r\n\r\n44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA\r\n\r\nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR \r\nTHE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, \r\npressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed \r\nby Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each \r\nsupporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his \r\nwound.\r\n\r\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It \r\nis the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing \r\nand a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThat's all any of us can see.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (blinking)\r\nThen I guess I'm getting better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind \r\ndies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. \r\nThreepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.\r\n\r\nHAN \t(turning to Luke)\r\nI've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (shrugging it off)\r\nI had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNo, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest \r\nthing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide \r\nawake nothing!\r\n\r\nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, \r\nmussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.\r\n\r\nLUKE \t(moving to his ship)\r\nI'll see you back at the fleet.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhy don't you leave that crate and come with us?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\r\n\r\nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.\r\n\r\nHAN\t\t\r\n(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's \r\nbetrayal and subsequent aide)\r\nGuess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nFigured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the \r\nrest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHe means \"You're welcome.\"\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nCome on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.\r\n\r\n44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE \r\n\r\nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and \r\npeels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and \r\ngrows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.\r\n\r\n45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the \r\ncanopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM \r\nFALCON.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI'll meet you back at the fleet.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (over comlink)\r\nHurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (over comlink)\r\nHey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.\r\n\r\nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of \r\nLuke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black \r\nglove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThat's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a \r\npromise to keep... to an old friend.\r\n\r\n46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR\r\n\r\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in \r\nspace above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, \r\nEndor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward \r\nthe Death Star.\r\n\r\n47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous \r\nDeath Star commander.\r\n\r\n48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth \r\ndocking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where \r\nthe shuttle is coming to rest.\r\n\r\nThe shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and \r\ncreate a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention \r\nwith a momentous SNAP.\r\n\r\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a \r\nrather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way \r\ndown the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak \r\nsimilar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's \r\nface is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow \r\neyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme \r\nRuler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (to Vader)\r\nRise, my friend.\r\n\r\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way \r\nalong the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay \r\nkneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several \r\nImperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the \r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue \r\nyour search for young Skywalker.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYes, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, \r\nyou must bring him\r\nbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the \r\ndark side of the\r\nForce.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nAs you wish.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nEverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\r\n\r\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial \r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH\r\n\r\nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of \r\nthe swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps \r\ndisconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm \r\nyellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.\r\n\r\n50   INT YODA'S HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of \r\nthe cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that \r\nclutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. \r\nHis manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\r\n\r\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look \r\nhas been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo... of course not.\r\n\r\nYODA\t (tickled, chuckles)\r\nI do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. \r\n(Points a crooked finger)\r\nWhen nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\r\n\r\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nSoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\r\n\r\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMaster Yoda, you can't die.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me \r\nand soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the \r\nForce.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nNo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\r\n\r\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen I am a Jedi?\r\n\r\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\r\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, \r\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\r\n\r\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his \r\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\r\n\r\nYoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile \r\ncreases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\r\n\r\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYoda, I must know.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nYour father he is.\r\n\r\nLuke reacts as if cut.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nTold you, did he?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nUnfortunate that I know the truth?\r\n\r\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\r\n\r\nYODA\t\t (gathering all his strength)\r\nNo. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your \r\ntraining. Not\r\nready for the burden were you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWell, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nRemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, \r\nfear, aggression.\r\nThe dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever \r\nwill it dominate your\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nLuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, \r\nor suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I\r\n(cough),\r\nthe last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your \r\nfamily. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... \r\n(with great effort)\r\nThere is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.\r\n\r\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green \r\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears \r\nin front of his eyes.\r\n\r\n51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING \r\n\r\nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, \r\nbut is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to \r\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (OS)\r\nYoda will always be with you.\r\n\r\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\r\n\r\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be \r\nAnakin Skywalker\r\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your \r\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a \r\ncertain point of view.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\r\nA certain point of view!\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend \r\ngreatly on our own\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it \r\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened \r\nto your father was my fault.\r\n\r\nBen pauses sadly.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nAnakin was a good friend.\r\n\r\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a \r\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was \r\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to \r\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well \r\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the \r\ngalaxy.\r\n\r\nLuke is entranced.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's still good in him.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be \r\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't do it, Ben.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience \r\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value \r\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you \r\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been \r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I had to help my friends.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\r\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved \r\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\r\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side \r\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest \r\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what \r\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're \r\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, \r\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't kill my own father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYoda spoke of another.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I have no sister.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your \r\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were \r\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the \r\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They \r\ndo you credit.\r\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\r\n\r\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\r\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your \r\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep \r\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you \r\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia \r\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\r\n\r\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\r\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in \r\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew \r\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, \r\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family \r\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster \r\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of \r\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the \r\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a \r\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she \r\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had \r\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became \r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his \r\nsister.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, \r\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your \r\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy \r\nVader!\r\n\r\n52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a \r\ndozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and \r\nbattlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the \r\nHEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\r\n\r\n53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\r\n\r\nHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in \r\nthe WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a \r\nholographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the \r\nnearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern \r\nbut beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several \r\nmilitary leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a \r\nsalmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he \r\nfinds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.\r\n\r\nHan peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, look at you, a general, huh?\r\n\r\n LANDO\r\n Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the \r\nbattle of Taanab.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (sarcastic)\r\nWell, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I \r\ndidn't know they were\r\nlookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\r\n\r\nLANDO\t (smiling)\r\nI'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable \r\none, remember?\r\n\r\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA\r\nThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has \r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the \r\nDeath Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the \r\ncenter of the room.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA\r\nThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location \r\nof the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon \r\nsystems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial \r\nFleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is \r\nrelatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that \r\nthe Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the \r\nconstruction of this Death Star.\r\n\r\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd.

Admiral Ackbar, please.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field \r\nand the Moon of Endor.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. \r\nAlthough the weapon\r\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does \r\nhave a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, \r\nwhich is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield \r\nmust be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield \r\nis down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly \r\ninto the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\r\n\r\nThere's a concerned murmur.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\t (cont)\r\nGeneral Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\r\n\r\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nLando nods his thanks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou're gonna need it.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nGeneral Madine.\r\n\r\nMadine moves center stage.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MADINE\r\nWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-\r\nbyes and start up the ramp.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the \r\nhelp you can get. She's\r\nthe fastest ship in the fleet.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take \r\ngood care of her.\r\nShe-she won't get a scratch.

Like I'm not gonna see her again.\r\n\r\nChewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the \r\nFalcon, too.

There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair \r\nbefore a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death \r\nStar to the giant green moon of Endor.\r\n\r\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, \r\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After \r\nseveral tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhat is thy bidding, my Master?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until \r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nIt is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young \r\nSkywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go \r\nout to the command ship and await my orders.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYes, my Master.\r\n\r\nVader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks \r\ntoward the waiting council members.\r\n\r\n58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction \r\nproceeds on the Death Star.

After a moment \r\nof stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL \r\nPIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen \r\nearlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhere is that shuttle going?\r\n\r\nPIETT\t (into comlink)\r\nShuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?\r\n\r\nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)\r\nParts and technical crew for the forest moon.\r\n\r\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nDo they have a code clearance?\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out.

No problem.\r\n\r\n62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR\r\n\r\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.\r\n\r\n63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR\r\n\r\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, \r\nprimeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\r\n\r\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a \r\nsteep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The \r\ntroops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio \r\nbringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\r\n\r\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly \r\nto the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke \r\ncrawl up to take a look.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, I told you it was dangerous here.\r\n\r\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering \r\nthrough bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked \r\nnearby.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nShall we try and go around?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.\r\n\r\nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie \r\nstart quietly down.\r\n\r\n64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE\r\n\r\nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far \r\nfrom the two Imperial scouts.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nQuietly, there might be more of them out there.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (grins)\r\nHey... it's me.\r\n\r\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. \r\nLuke and Leia exchange smiles.\r\n\r\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout \r\nwhirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #1\r\nGo for help! Go!\r\n\r\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie \r\ngets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to \r\ncrash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (sarcastic)\r\nGreat. Come on.\r\n\r\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol \r\ndrawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where \r\ntwo more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied \r\nbike parked nearby.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOver there! Two more of them!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI see them. Wait, Leia!\r\n\r\nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She \r\nstarts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls)\r\nQuick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\r\n\r\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely \r\navoiding two huge trees.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, wait! Ahhh!\r\n\r\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\r\n\r\n65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE\r\n\r\nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia \r\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from \r\ntheir bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMove closer!\r\n\r\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer \r\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, \r\nslowing the scout.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGet alongside that one!\r\n\r\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their \r\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of \r\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him \r\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike \r\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the \r\nremaining scout.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGet him!\r\n\r\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing \r\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser \r\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a \r\nglancing hit.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\r\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\r\n\r\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into \r\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as \r\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and \r\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a \r\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted \r\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\r\n\r\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into \r\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\r\n\r\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom \r\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and \r\nrises out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia \r\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes \r\na glancing hit.\r\n\r\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches \r\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has \r\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike \r\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. \r\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a \r\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a \r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue \r\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The \r\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a \r\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top \r\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a \r\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside \r\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all \r\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able \r\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the \r\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are \r\nmoving as one.\r\n\r\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and \r\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's \r\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find \r\nLuke.\r\n\r\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and \r\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and \r\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it \r\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, \r\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty \r\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, \r\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\r\n\r\n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait \r\nanxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed \r\nhead and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\r\n\r\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's \r\ntoo tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke! Where's Leia?\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (concerned)\r\nWhat? She didn't come back?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI thought she was with you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWe got separated.\r\n\r\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHey, we better go look for her.\r\n\r\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nTake the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.\r\n\r\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the \r\nsquad proceeds in another.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDon't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.\r\n\r\nThey move off into the woods.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo)\r\nAnd you said it was pretty here. Ugh!\r\n\r\n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\r\n\r\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into \r\nview. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat \r\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this \r\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up \r\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where \r\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and \r\ndisheveled.\r\n\r\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a \r\ndefensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins \r\npoking her with the sharp point of the spear.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCut it out!\r\n\r\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\r\n\r\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of \r\nher speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here \r\nis.\r\n\r\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from \r\nher fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log \r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\r\n\r\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia \r\npats the log again.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\r\n\r\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nAll right. You want something to eat?\r\n\r\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. \r\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously \r\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\r\n\r\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the \r\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps \r\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her \r\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery \r\nlittle thing, aren't you?\r\n\r\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming \r\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to \r\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning \r\nto Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log \r\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding \r\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears \r\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the \r\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL \r\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches \r\nout his hand for her weapon.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #l\r\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\r\n\r\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage \r\nin front of the log.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #1\r\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #2\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the \r\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout \r\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. \r\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, \r\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and \r\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's \r\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once \r\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards \r\nLeia with\u00canew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking \r\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the \r\ndense foliage.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCome on, let's get outta here.\r\n\r\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and \r\ntugs at Leia to follow him.\r\n\r\n68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER\r\n\r\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private \r\nelevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\r\n\r\nVADER        \r\n(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the \r\nForce)\r\nThe Emperor will see me, now!\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\n(repeating Vader's command)\r\nThe Emperor will see you, now.\r\n\r\n69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens \r\nto reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It \r\nappears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He \r\nwaits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark \r\nLord.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nI told you to remain on the command ship.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (no surprise)\r\nYes, I know.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (after a beat)\r\nMy son is with them.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (very cool)\r\nAre you sure?\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nI have felt him, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are \r\nclear, Lord\r\nVader.\r\n\r\nVader knows what is being asked.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThey are clear, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (skeptical)\r\nHe will come to me?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will \r\ncome to you and\r\nthen you will bring him before me.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (bows)\r\nAs you wish.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\r\n\r\n70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\r\n\r\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move \r\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. \r\nLuke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (OS)\r\nLuke! Luke!\r\n\r\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage \r\nof a speeder bike in the grass.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Master Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\r\n\r\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (gravely)\r\nI hope she's alright.\r\n\r\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off \r\nthrough the foliage.\r\n\r\n                              HAN\r\nWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!\r\n\r\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, \r\nArtoo whistles nervously.\r\n\r\n71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE\r\n\r\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a \r\ntall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from \r\nit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, I don't get it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nNah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.\r\n\r\nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nChewie, wa-wait!  Don't!\r\n\r\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. \r\nSPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, \r\nsuspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of \r\nbeeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a \r\njumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this \r\nthing. \r\n(trying to free an arm) \r\nHan, can you reach my lightsaber?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYeah, sure.\r\n\r\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting \r\nappendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an \r\narm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to \r\nspin.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-\r\nop!!\r\n\r\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, \r\ncrashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they \r\nrealize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long \r\nspear.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\r\n\r\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok \r\nwarrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. \r\nHe grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHan, don't. It'll be all right.\r\n\r\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets \r\nthem take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nChewie, give 'em your crossbow.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free \r\nof the net and sits up, rattled.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\r\n\r\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among \r\nthemselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok \r\nnearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In \r\na moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled \r\nbark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks \r\nbegin to chant at Threepio.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nDo you understand anything they're saying?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million \r\nforms of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat are you telling them?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive \r\ndialect.  But\r\nI do believe they think I am some sort of god.\r\n\r\nChewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange \r\n\"what next?\" looks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nProper?!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\r\n\r\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhy, you--\r\n\r\nSeveral Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their \r\ngod. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a \r\nmenacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands \r\nplacatingly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\r\n\r\n72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their \r\nprisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and \r\nwrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\r\n\r\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the \r\ncaptives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the \r\nremaining creatures.\r\n\r\n73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST\r\n\r\nThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the \r\ngiant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into \r\nnothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts \r\nand rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes \r\nhold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other \r\nEwoks follow suit.\r\n\r\n74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE\r\n\r\nThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks \r\ngather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the \r\nnewcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\r\n\r\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is \r\nplaced on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others \r\nare leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently \r\nplaced near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and \r\nChewie are less than fascinated.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI have a really bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\nChewie growls his concern.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes \r\nout of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join \r\nThreepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A \r\nlarger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber \r\nwith great curiosity.\r\n\r\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing \r\nto the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit \r\nunder Han with firewood.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat did he say?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the \r\nmain course at a\r\nbanquet in my honor.\r\n\r\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. \r\nLeia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening \r\nat the same moment the prisoners see her.\r\n\r\nHAN and LUKE\r\nLeia!\r\n\r\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOh!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYour Royal Highness.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the \r\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nBut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.\r\n\r\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads \r\nnegatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks \r\nsome orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue \r\nwith vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry \r\nand use your magic.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJust tell them.\r\n\r\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps \r\nforward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to \r\nconcentrate.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\r\n\r\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the \r\nground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\n... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! \r\nOh!\r\n\r\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio \r\nbegins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio \r\ncalling out in total panic at his situation.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! \r\nMaster Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\r\n\r\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and \r\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group \r\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at \r\nhim, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. \r\nLogray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. \r\nWhen the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo \r\nbeeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, \r\nfinally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The \r\nEwok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group \r\nof Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and \r\nmarveling at his height.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThanks, Threepio.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken)\r\nI...I never knew I had it in me.\r\n\r\n75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS\r\n\r\nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, \r\ncreating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a \r\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. \r\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the \r\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\r\n\r\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's \r\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally \r\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the \r\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, \r\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. \r\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable \r\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\r\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\r\n\r\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han \r\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in \r\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\r\n\r\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer \r\nand screeches.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat's going on?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something \r\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not \r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nJust what I always wanted.\r\n\r\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket \r\nclings to Han's leg.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (chuckles)\r\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. \r\n(to Wicket) \r\nThank you. Okay.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield \r\ngenerator.\r\n\r\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders \r\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try \r\nand get our weapons back.\r\n\r\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.\r\n\r\n76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and \r\nflicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft \r\nnight air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands \r\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, what's wrong?\r\n\r\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWhat do you remember?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nTell me.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\n(a little surprised at his insistence)\r\nShe was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.\r\n(looks up)\r\nWhy are you asking me all this?\r\n\r\nHe looks away.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, tell me. What's troubling you?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nVader is here...now, on this moon.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (alarmed)\r\nHow do you know?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. \r\nThat's why I have to go.\r\n(facing her)\r\nAs long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.\r\n(beat)\r\nI have to face him.\r\n\r\nLeia is distraught, confused.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHe's my father.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nYour father?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I \r\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\r\n\r\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and \r\ncould never have.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to \r\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has \r\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\r\n\r\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she \r\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYes. It's you Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen you know why I have to face him.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave \r\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nBut, why must you confront him?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to \r\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I \r\nhave to try.\r\n\r\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\r\n\r\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He \r\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed \r\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and \r\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only \r\nnow that she is crying.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, what's goin' on?\r\n\r\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (angry)\r\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\r\n\r\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI...I can't tell you.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\r\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI...\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAhhh...\r\n\r\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm sorry.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHold me.\r\n\r\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.\r\n\r\n77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM\r\n\r\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands \r\ngracefully on the huge platform.\r\n\r\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of \r\nthe forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks \r\nparticularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\r\n\r\n78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK\r\n\r\nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into \r\nan elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward \r\nanother ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, \r\nin binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with \r\ncomplete calm.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I \r\nbelieve there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct \r\na further search of the area.\r\n\r\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nHe was armed only with this.\r\n\r\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the \r\nlightsaber from the commander's hand.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his \r\ncompanions to me.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nYes, my Lord.\r\n\r\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone \r\nin the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest \r\nfilter in upon them.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Emperor has been expecting you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI know, father.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nSo, you have accepted the truth.\r\n\r\nLURE\r\nI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (turning to face him)\r\nThat name no longer has any meaning for me.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there \r\nis good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is \r\nwhy you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your \r\nEmperor now.\r\n\r\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved \r\nhand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (indicating lightsaber)\r\nI see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\r\n\r\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, \r\nbrilliant blade.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has \r\nforeseen.\r\n\r\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome with me.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nObi-Wan once thought as you do.\r\n\r\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIf that is your destiny.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nSearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict \r\nwithin you. Let go\r\nof your hate.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature \r\nof the Force. He is\r\nyour master now.\r\n\r\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring \r\nat one another for a long moment.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen my father is truly dead.\r\n\r\n79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, \r\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield \r\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing \r\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that \r\nlanding platform. This\r\nisn't gonna be easy.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily \r\nguarded than this.\r\n\r\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to \r\nThreepio.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhat's he saying?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\r\n\r\n80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star \r\nCruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a \r\nspot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\r\n\r\n81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some \r\ngetting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando \r\nspeaks into his comlink.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.\r\n\r\nACKBAR \t(VO)\r\nProceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\r\n\r\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nDon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down \r\non time...\r\n(to himself) \r\nor this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.\r\n\r\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\t (VO)\r\nAll craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right. Stand by.\r\n\r\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\r\n\r\n82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then \r\nAckbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS \r\nINTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\r\n\r\n83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and \r\nPaploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is \r\nspread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that \r\nleads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes \r\nparked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an \r\nobservation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nBack door, huh? Good idea.\r\n\r\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nIt's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (with self-confident grin)\r\nThen we'll do it real quiet-like.\r\n\r\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks \r\nchatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers \r\ninto the underbrush.\r\n\r\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nQuiet.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOh, no.\r\n\r\n84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial \r\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto \r\none of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at \r\nrandom. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. \r\nPaploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in \r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n85   EXT RIDGE\r\n\r\nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\r\n\r\nHAN \t(sighs)\r\nThere goes our surprise attack.\r\n\r\n86   EXT BUNKER\r\n\r\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into \r\nmotion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.\r\n\r\nSCOUT\r\nLook! Over there! Stop him!\r\n\r\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away \r\nin pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.\r\n\r\n87   EXT RIDGE\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. \r\nWe'll take care of this.\r\n\r\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. \r\nThreepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI have decided that we shall stay here.\r\n\r\n88   EXT FOREST\r\n\r\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, \r\nbut he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him \r\nand begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds \r\na tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the \r\ntrees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the \r\nstill-flying, unoccupied bike.\r\n\r\n89   EXT BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the \r\nshoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms \r\nof the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps \r\nout a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out \r\nof sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No \r\nsign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout \r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk \r\nacross the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side \r\nby side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.\r\n\r\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down \r\nat Luke's binders.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou no longer need those.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders \r\nfall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, \r\nfree now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGuards, leave us.\r\n\r\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (to Luke)\r\nI'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call \r\nme Master.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. \r\nThe Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can \r\nperceive the evil visage within the hood.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are \r\nmistaken...about a great many things.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nHis lightsaber.\r\n\r\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's \r\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know \r\nyour father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with \r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor laughs.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\r\n\r\nLuke looks up sharply.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\r\n\r\nVader looks at Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYour overconfidence is your weakness.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour faith in your friends is yours.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIt is pointless to resist, my son.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (angry)\r\nEverything that has transpired has done so according to my design. \r\n(indicates Endor)\r\nYour friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\r\n\r\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (cont)\r\n...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who \r\nallowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It \r\nis quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my \r\nbest troops awaits them.\r\n\r\nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword \r\nin the Emperor's hand.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nOh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when \r\nyour friends arrive.\r\n\r\n91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and \r\nenter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. \r\nLeia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nCharges!  Come on, come on!\r\n\r\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more \r\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at \r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket)\r\nOh, my! They'll be captured!\r\n\r\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into \r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.\r\n\r\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial \r\ncommander enters.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nFreeze! You Rebel scum.\r\n\r\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them \r\nand their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. \r\nEven more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. \r\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.\r\n\r\n92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the \r\nRebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The \r\nMillennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the \r\nspace armada bears down on its target.\r\n\r\n93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll wings report in.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nRed Leader standing by.\r\n\r\nGRAY LEADER\r\nGray Leader standing by.\r\n\r\nGREEN LEADER\r\nGreen Leader standing by.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nLock S-foils in attack positions.\r\n\r\n94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar \r\nwatches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nMay the Force be with us.\r\n\r\n95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to \r\nthe control panel and talks to Lando.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up \r\nor down. Well, how\r\ncould they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.\r\n\r\nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the \r\nimplications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his \r\ncomlink.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nBreak off the attack! The shield is still up.\r\n\r\nRED LEADER\t (VO)\r\nI get no reading. Are you sure?\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nPull up! All craft pull up!\r\n\r\nThe Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the \r\nDeath Star move off right.\r\n\r\n96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD\r\n\r\nThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid \r\nthe unseen wall.\r\n\r\n97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes \r\ncourse abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the \r\narmada tries to halt its forward momentum.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nTake evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.\r\n\r\nA Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to \r\nAckbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER\r\nAdmiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.\r\n\r\nOn the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive \r\nImperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nIt's a trap!\r\n\r\nLANDO\t (over comlink)\r\nFighters coming in.\r\n\r\nThere is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an \r\narmada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in \r\nand around the giant Rebel cruisers.\r\n\r\nREBEL PILOT\r\nThere's too many of them!\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAccelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nCopy, Gold Leader.\r\n\r\nThe battle continues around the giant cruisers.\r\n\r\n98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThrough the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the \r\ndistant flashes of the space battle in progress.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nCome, boy. See for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. \r\nLuke moves to look through a small section of the window.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and \r\nthe end of your insignificant Rebellion.\r\n\r\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest \r\nof the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the \r\nlightsaber.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your \r\nJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to \r\nyour anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my \r\nservant.\r\n\r\nVader watches Luke in his agony.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nIt is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now \r\nmine!\r\n\r\n99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the \r\nbunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now \r\ncrowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial \r\ntroops. The situation looks hopeless.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!\r\n\r\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps \r\nand whistles. \r\nAnd --\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?\r\n\r\nBUNKER COMMANDER\r\nBring those two down here!\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nLet's go!\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six \r\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids \r\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nFreeze! Don't move!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWe surrender.\r\n\r\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting \r\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a \r\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\r\n\r\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK \r\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their \r\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and \r\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting \r\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the \r\ntrees above.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for \r\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes \r\nto the bunker door control panel.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHere's the terminal.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\r\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround \r\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of \r\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, \r\nruns after him.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? \r\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\r\n\r\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the \r\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\r\n\r\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They \r\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns \r\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks \r\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker \r\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge \r\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\r\n\r\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's \r\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged \r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts \r\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between \r\ntwo trees.\r\n\r\n100  EXT SPACE\r\n\r\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat \r\nwith Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the \r\nRebel armada.\r\n\r\n101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel \r\nsquads.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWatch yourself, Wedge!

I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical \r\nfrigate.\r\n\r\nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at \r\nthe TIEs from the belly guns.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATOR\r\nPressure's steady.\r\n\r\nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nOnly the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers \r\nare waiting for.\r\n\r\n102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET  \r\n\r\nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the \r\nbattle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of \r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\n103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAdmiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge \r\nwindow of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nWe're in attack position now, sir.\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nHold here.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nWe're not going to attack?\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nI have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special \r\nplanned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.\r\n\r\n104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle \r\nfireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship \r\nexplodes against the protective shield.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now \r\nwitness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle \r\nstation.\r\n(into comlink)\r\nFire at will, Commander.\r\n\r\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the \r\nRebel fleet beyond.\r\n\r\n105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands \r\nover them.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nFire!\r\n\r\n106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\r\n\r\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded \r\nImperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of \r\nlight emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side \r\nat a control panel.\r\n\r\n107  EXT DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to \r\nglow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.\r\n\r\n108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings \r\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is \r\nhit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE \r\nfighters.\r\n\r\n109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. \r\nLando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star \r\nfirepower.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nThat blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! \r\n(into comlink)\r\nHome One, this is Gold Leader.\r\n\r\n110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the \r\ncomlink.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nWe saw it.

We've got to give him more time.\r\n\r\n111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover \r\nfire.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWe're coming!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nCome on! Come on!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Artoo, hurry!\r\n\r\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A \r\nlarge explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally \r\nlanding on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and \r\nsmoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn \r\naround to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his \r\nappendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in \r\nhis body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded \r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'll cover you.\r\n\r\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the \r\nstormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the \r\nwing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting \r\nlaser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are \r\nstruck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then \r\nrealizes that he is dead.\r\n\r\n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death \r\nStar's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star \r\nDestroyers.\r\n\r\n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating \r\ngiants. He's been yelling into the comlink.\r\n\r\nLANDO\t (desperately)\r\nYes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star \r\nDestroyers at point-\r\nblank range.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might \r\njust take a few of\r\nthem with us.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and \r\nbegin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the \r\ngiant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.\r\n\r\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\r\n\r\nREBEL PILOT\r\nShe's gonna blow!\r\n\r\nY-WING PILOT\r\nI'm hit!\r\n\r\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into \r\nthe control tower, exploding.\r\n\r\n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being \r\ndecimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there \r\nis no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not \r\nsurvive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will \r\ndie...as will your friends.\r\n\r\nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! \r\nStrike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark \r\nside will be complete.\r\n\r\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He \r\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber \r\nflashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the \r\nEmperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his \r\nfather.\r\n\r\n115  EXT FOREST\r\n\r\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated \r\nweapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the \r\nImperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.\r\n\r\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An \r\nEwok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The \r\nlogs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until \r\nit finally topples over with a great crash.\r\n\r\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end \r\nof the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-\r\ntightening circles until it runs out of rope and\r\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\r\n\r\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks \r\ncling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, \r\nthen hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.\r\n\r\nWALKER PILOT #1\r\nLook!\r\n\r\nPILOT #2\r\nGet him off of there!\r\n\r\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked \r\nout and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into \r\nthe cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are \r\nthrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, \r\nChewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch \r\nwith a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to \r\nlisten to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\r\n\r\nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at \r\nunsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The \r\nEwoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the \r\nbattle in their favor.\r\n\r\n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to \r\nhotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some \r\nstormtroopers.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI think I got it. I got it!\r\n\r\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a \r\nsecond blast door crashes down in front of the first.\r\n\r\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with \r\nstormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her \r\nshoulder hit by a laser blast.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLet's see.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nIt's not bad.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS)\r\nFreeze!\r\n\r\nThey freeze.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, dear.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nDon't move!\r\n\r\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two \r\nstormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment \r\nseems suspended in time.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI love you.\r\n\r\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nHands up! Stand up!\r\n\r\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She \r\ndisposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward \r\nLeia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, \r\nits deadly weapons aimed right at him.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (to Leia)\r\nStay back.\r\n\r\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and \r\nbarks triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie!

But the young Jedi has grown \r\nstronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is \r\nforced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke \r\nstands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR (laughing)\r\nGood.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through \r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and \r\nrealizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his \r\nlightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nObi-Wan has taught you well.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not fight you, father.\r\n\r\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou are unwise to lower your defenses.\r\n\r\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in \r\nan amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader \r\nstands below him.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the \r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThere is no conflict.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe \r\nyou'll destroy me\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, \r\nthen you will meet\r\nyour destiny.\r\n\r\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding \r\nthe catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground \r\nin a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's \r\nplatform. Vader moves to find him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (laughs)\r\nGood.  Good.\r\n\r\n118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each \r\nother in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer \r\nexplodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a \r\nseries of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next \r\nto a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the \r\nImperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack \r\none of the larger Imperial ships.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWatch out.

There is a great deal of static and \r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nHAN/PILOT\t (VO)\r\nIt's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into \r\nthe woods.

Open the back door.\r\n\r\nSECOND COMMANDER\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\n120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, \r\nthey're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their \r\nweapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the \r\nroof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\r\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\r\n\r\n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant \r\nexplosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThrow me another charge.\r\n\r\n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, \r\nsearching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou cannot hide forever, Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not fight you.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your \r\nfriends. Yes, your\r\nthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially \r\nfor...\r\n\r\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in \r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed \r\nher, too. Obi-Wan\r\nwas wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will \r\nnot turn to the dark\r\nside, then perhaps she will.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNever-r-r!\r\n\r\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather \r\nwith a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader \r\nfight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of \r\nthe low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. \r\nEach stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to \r\nblock another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the \r\nwrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical \r\nstump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the\r\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves \r\nover Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. \r\nThe Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and \r\ntake your father's\r\nplace at my side!\r\n\r\nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, \r\nblack-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his \r\nfather. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in \r\npreparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. \r\nI am a Jedi,\r\nlike my father before me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nSo be it...Jedi.\r\n\r\n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across \r\nthe clearing.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nMove! Move!\r\n\r\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a \r\nspectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes \r\nalong with the bunker.\r\n\r\n124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nThe shield is down!

Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. \r\n(laughs)\r\nTold you they'd do it!\r\n\r\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward \r\nthe unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\r\n\r\n125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The \r\nEmperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's \r\nhands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the \r\nForce to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a \r\nmoment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the \r\nyoung Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader \r\nstruggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\r\n\r\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the \r\nEmperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into \r\nthe bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You \r\nhave paid the price for\r\nyour lack of vision.\r\n\r\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward \r\nwhere Vader stands watching.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (groans)\r\nFather, please. Help me.\r\n\r\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, \r\nthen back to Luke on the floor.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nNow, young Skywalker...you will die.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts \r\nfrom the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound \r\nscreaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.\r\n\r\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed \r\nfigure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. \r\nThe Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now \r\nlifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to \r\nstrike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his \r\nhelmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high \r\nover his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of \r\nthe throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, \r\nDarth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls \r\ninto the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it \r\nexplodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is \r\nwhipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the \r\nbottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away \r\nfrom the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant \r\nwarrior are too weak to move.\r\n\r\n126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star \r\nto the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of \r\nthe giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nI'm going in.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHere goes nothing.\r\n\r\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed \r\nby the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who \r\ncontinually fire at the Rebels.

REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\n\nApart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is \nstrangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing \nhallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls \nand some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the \nunderground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a \nshambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a \ngigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and \nThreepio near one of the control boards.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tYou all right?\n\nLeia nods.

HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN\n\nOn the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over \nhim.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing \noverhead.\n\nRunning beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at \nthe walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the \ngun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.\n\nStill running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his \nbelt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling \nunderneath the walker.\n\nThe walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen \nsnow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to \nthe walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke \ncuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.\n\nHe takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the \nImperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto \nthe icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg \npasses by - and just misses him.\n\nThe giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from \nwithin - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every \nconceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like \na locomotive on stilts.\n\nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD\n\nVeers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.

HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR\n\nChewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.  \nThe giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a \nfew reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain, \nsomething at last catches his eye.\n\nChewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward \nthe ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, \nthen runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, \nclosely followed by Threepio.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tHurry up, goldenrod, or you're \n\t\tgoing to be a permanent resident!\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tWait!

An alarm buzzes in the background, \nArtoo beeps and whistles frantically.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t\t(into comlink)\n\t\tI know, I know!  All the scopes are \n\t\tdead.  I can't see a thing!  Just \n\t\thang on, I'm going to start the \n\t\tlanding cycle...\n\nThe blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's \nelectronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs \nwere being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the \nspacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.\n\nEXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK\n\nThe mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  \nLuke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out \nof his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which \nis barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make \nout are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tNo, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll \n\t\thave a look around.\n\nArtoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses \nhis balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo?\n\nLuke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water \nis still and reveals no sign of the little droid.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo!  Where are you?\n\nA small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is \nheard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts \nrunning along the nose of the fighter to its tip.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo!  You be more careful.\n\nThe outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.\n\nLuke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and \nturns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward \nshore.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo - that way!\n\nSuddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving \ntoward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the \nswampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The \ndroid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.\n\nHolding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into \nthe murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo!\n\nThe black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin \nto appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the \nwater, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of \nsoft gray moss.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tOh, no!  Are you all right?  Come \n\t\ton.  You're lucky you don't taste \n\t\tvery good.  Anything broken?\n\nLuke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from \nhis round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tIf you're saying coming here was \n\t\ta bad idea, I'm beginning to agree \n\t\twith you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we \n\t\tdoing here?  It's like... something \n\t\tout of a dream, or, I don't know.  \n\t\tMaybe I'm just going crazy.\n\nAs Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, \nArtoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.\n\nEXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER\n\nAdmiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.\n\nAfter a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising \nsight before him.\n\nDarth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far \nside of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the \nvarious apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts \nfrom Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar \ntissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet \nonto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face \nPiett.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tYes, Admiral?\n\n\t\t\t\tPIETT\nOur ships have sighted the \nMillennium Falcon, lord.  But... \nit has entered an asteroid field \nand we cannot risk...\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\tAsteroids do not concern me, \n\t\tAdmiral.  I want that ship and \n\t\tnot excuses.\n\n\t\t\t\tPIETT\n\t\tYes, lord.\n\nEXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON\n\nThe pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so \ndark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHan and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.  \nThreepio and Leia watch worriedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tI'm going to shut down everything \n\t\tbut the emergency power systems.  \n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tSir, I'm almost afraid to ask, \n\t\tbut... does that include shutting \n\t\tme down, too?\n\nChewie barks \"yes\".  But Han thinks otherwise.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tNo, I need you to talk to the \n\t\tFalcon, find out what's wrong with \n\t\tthe hyperdrive.\n\nSuddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit \nto go flying.  Chewie howls.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tSir, it's quite possible this \n\t\tasteroid is not entirely stable.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tNot entirely stable?  I'm glad you're \n\t\there to tell us these things.  Chewie, \n\t\ttake the professor in the back and \n\t\tplug him into the hyperdrive.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOh!  Sometimes I just don't \n\t\tunderstand human behavior.  After \n\t\tall, I'm only trying to do my job \n\t\tin the most...\n\nThe sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he \nmove back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia \nacross the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as \nsuddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they \nare in each other's arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tLet go.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tSshh!\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tLet go, please.\n\nLeia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get \nfree.  But, of course, Han blows it...\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tDon't get excited.\n\nThe anger rises in Leia.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tCaptain, being held by you isn't \n\t\tquite enough to get me excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tSorry, sweetheart.  We haven't \n\t\tgot time for anything else.\n\nHan grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the \ndoor.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.\n\nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK\n\nThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking \nswamp.\n\nLuke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites \na little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power \ncable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tReady for some power?  Okay.  \n\t\tLet's see now.  Put that in \n\t\tthere.  There you go.\n\nThe droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of \nprocessed food and sits before the thermal heater.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t\t(sighs)\n\t\tNow all I have to do is find this \n\t\tYoda... if he even exists.\n\nNervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tStill... there's something familiar \n\t\tabout this place.  I feel like... \n\t\tI don't know...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTRANGE VOICE\n\t\tFeel like what?\n\nLuke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young \nwarrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the \nspeaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, \nbluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing \nis dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t\t(looking at the \n\t\t\t creature)\n\t\tLike we're being watched!\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tAway with your weapon!  I mean \n\t\tyou no harm.\n\nAfter some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really \ndoesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tI am wondering, why are you here?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'm looking for someone.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tLooking?

A great warrior.\n\t\t\t(laughs and shakes \n\t\t\t his head)\n\t\tWars not make one great.\n\nWith the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of \nthe cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.\n\nArtoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the \ncreature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his \ndisapproval.\n\nTheir tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from \nand takes a bite.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tPut that down.  Hey!  That's my \n\t\tdinner!\n\nThe creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tHow you get so big, eating food \n\t\tof this kind?\n\nHe flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of \nLuke's supply cases.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tListen, friend, we didn't mean to \n\t\tland in that puddle, and if we \n\t\tcould get our ship out, we would, \n\t\tbut we can't, so why don't you just...\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\t\t(teasing)\n\t\tAww, cannot get your ship out?\n\nThe creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses \npatience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a \ntiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tHey, you could have broken this.\n\t\tDon't do that.  Ohhh... you're \n\t\tmaking a mess.  Hey, give me that!\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\t\t(retreating with \n\t\t\t the lamp)\n\t\tMine!  Or I will help you not.\n\nClutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing \ncloser to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little \narms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by \nthe creature.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI don't want your help.  I want \n\t\tmy lamp back.  I'll need it to \n\t\tget out of this slimy mudhole.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tMudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.\n\nArtoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately \nengaged in a tug-of-war over it.\n\nArtoo beeps a few angry, \"Give me thats.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tAh, ah, ah!\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tOh, Artoo, let him have it!\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tMine!  Mine!\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tArtoo!\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tMine!\n\nThe creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one \nfinger.

Good food.  Come.\n\nWith that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.  \nLuke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small \npower lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts \nafter the creature.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\t\t(in the distance)\n\t\tCome, come.\n\nArtoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tStay here and watch after the \n\t\tcamp, Artoo.\n\nArtoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view, \nthe worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic \nsigh.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA\n\nThreepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in \nfront of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOh, where is Artoo when I need \n\t\thim?\n\nHan enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tSir, I don't know where your ship \n\t\tlearned to communicate, but it \n\t\thas the most peculiar dialect.  I \n\t\tbelieve, sir, it says that the \n\t\tpower coupling on the negative \n\t\taxis has been polarized.  I'm \n\t\tafraid you'll have to replace it.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tWell, of course I'll have to replace \n\t\tit.\n\nHe hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tHere!  And Chewie...\n\nChewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and \nwhines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so \nonly he can hear.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... I think we'd better replace \n\t\tthe negative power coupling.\n\nLeia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts \nto reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It \ndoesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She \nrebuffs him.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tHey, Your Worship, I'm only \n\t\ttrying to help.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\t\t(still struggling)\n\t\tWould you please stop calling me \n\t\tthat?\n\nHan hears a new tone in her voice.

Scoundrel?  I like \n\t\tthe sound of that.\n\nWith that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tStop that.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tStop what?\n\nLeia is flushes, confused.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tStop that!  My hands are dirty.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tMy hands are dirty, too.  What \n\t\tare you afraid of?\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\t\t(looking right \n\t\t\t into his eyes)\n\t\tAfraid?\n\nHan looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more \nhandsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and \ntakes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He \ndraws it toward him.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tYou're trembling.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tI'm not trembling.\n\nThen with an irresistible combination of physical strength and \nemotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... \nvery slowly.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tYou like me because I'm a scoundrel.\n\t\tThere aren't enough scoundrels in \n\t\tyour life.\n\nLeia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an \nexcited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tI happen to like nice men.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tI'm a nice man.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tNo, you're not.  You're...\n\nHe kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though \nhe had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed \nlike this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she \nregains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it \nhard to talk.\n\nSuddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tSir, sir!  I've isolated the \n\t\treverse power flux coupling.\n\nHan turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tThank you.  Thank you very much.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.\n\nThe moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.\n\nEXT.

A strange \nbaroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small \nlagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its \nthick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, \nthe stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of \nthe glowing portals.\n\nINT. CREATURE'S HOUSE\n\nArtoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very \nplain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the \ncreature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, \nwhose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits \ncross-legged on the floor of the living room.\n\nThe creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up \nan incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and \npans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding \nthat, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes \nback and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who \nwatches the creature impatiently.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tLook, I'm sure it's delicious.  \n\t\tI just don't understand why we \n\t\tcan't see Yoda now.\n\n\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n\t\tPatience!

Good, hmm?\n\nMoving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down \nnear the fire and serves himself from the pot.

He is upon the youth in seconds, but \nLuke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.\n\nVader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders \nas his body disappears into the darkness.

Lando \nspots Threepio's remains.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tHaving trouble with you droid?\n\nHan and Leia exchange a quick glance.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tNo.  No problem.  Why?\n\nHan and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and \nChewie.  The door slides closed behind them.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nLeia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance \nbehind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, \npure-white columns.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tSo you see, since we're a small \n\t\toperation, we don't fall into \n\t\tthe... uh... jurisdiction of the \n\t\tEmpire.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tSo you're part of the mining \n\t\tguild then?\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tNo, not actually.  Our operation \n\t\tis small enough not to be noticed... \n\t\twhich is advantageous for everybody \n\t\tsince our customers are anxious \n\t\tto avoid attracting attention to \n\t\tthemselves.\n\nThe group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at \nthe far end.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tAren't you afraid the Empire's \n\t\tgoing to find out about this \n\t\tlittle operation and shut you down?\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tThat's always been a danger looming \n\t\tlike a shadow over everything we've \n\t\tbuilt here.  But things have \n\t\tdeveloped that will insure security.\n\t\tI've just made a deal that will \n\t\tkeep the Empire out of here forever.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM\n\nThe mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the \ndining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  \nStanding at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty \nhunter.\n\nFaster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a \ncouple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his \nhand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they \nexplode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's \nhand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of \nhim.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tWe would be honored if you would \n\t\tjoin us.\n\nHan gives Lando a mean look.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tI had no choice.

We're almost there.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL\n\nChewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded \nwith hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle \nscreeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant \nfists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper \nlights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a \nwall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he \nmoves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He \npicks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, \nbarking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on \nits torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.\n\nSuddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches \ntwo connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his \nvoice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tMmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take \n\t\tthis off!  I, uh, don't mean to \n\t\tintrude here.  I, don't, no, no, \n\t\tno... Please don't get up.  No!\n\nChewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry \nhead.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio \nimmediately begins speaking normally.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tStormtroopers?  Here?  We're in \n\t\tdanger.  I must tell the others.\n\t\tOh, no!  I've been shot!\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA\n\nDarth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an \nelaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts \nforward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism, \ncreating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.\n\nThe door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a \nsharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding \nchamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.\n\nINT.

It would be unfortunate if \n\t\tI had to leave a garrison here.\n\nVader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks \nswiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tThis deal's getting worse all \n\t\tthe time.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL\n\nChewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is \nconnected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small \nproblem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's \nhead on backwards.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOh, yes, that's very good.  I like \n\t\tthat.  Oh!  Something's not right \n\t\tbecause now I can't see.  Wait.  \n\t\tWait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?  \n\t\tI'm backwards, you stupid furball.  \n\t\tOnly an overgrown mophead like you \n\t\twould be stupid enough...\n\nThreepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a \ncircuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and \nsits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is \nshoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the \nhuge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles \nunder his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tI feel terrible.\n\nChewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open \nrevealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers \npush her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han, \nwho is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking \nhis head.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tWhy are they doing this?\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tThey never even asked me any \n\t\tquestions.\n\nThe cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tLando.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tGet out of here, Lando!\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tShut up and listen!

You fixed us all pretty \n\t\tgood, didn't you?\n\t\t\t(spits it out)\n\t\tMy friend!\n\nHan hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged \nin a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle \nbutts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the \nguards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando \nstops them.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tStop!  I've done all I can.  I'm \n\t\tsorry I couldn't do better, but \n\t\tI have my own problems.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tYeah, you're a real hero.\n\nLando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia \nand Chewie help him up.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\t\t(dabs at his wound)\n\t\tYou certainly have a way with \n\t\tpeople.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n\nFour armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large \nchamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle \nof the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader \nand Lando stand near the platform.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tThis facility is crude, but it \n\t\tshould be adequate to freeze \n\t\tSkywalker for his journey to the \n\t\tEmperor.\n\nAn Imperial soldier appears.\n\n\t\t\t\tIMPERIAL SOLDIER\n\t\tLord Vader, ship approaching.\n\t\tX-wing class.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tGood.

LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT\n\nEncountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n\nThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six \nUgnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special \ncoffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a \nsquad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to \nChewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is \nThreepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's \nand the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see \nwhat is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, \nintermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The \nremaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back \nso that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tIf only you had attached my legs, \n\t\tI wouldn't be in this ridiculous \n\t\tposition.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, \n\t\tyou have a responsibility to me, \n\t\tso don't do anything foolish.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\t\t(to Lando)\n\t\tWhat's going on... buddy?\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tYou're being put into carbon freeze.\n\nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\tWhat if he doesn't survive?  He's \n\t\tworth a lot to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tThe Empire will compensate you \n\t\tif he dies.  Put him in!\n\nRealizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and \nattacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other \nImperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee \nwith their laser weapons.\n\nFrom the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in \npanic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, \n\t\tChewbacca, stop...!\n\nThe stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tStop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear \n\t\tme?  Stop!\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tYes, stop, please!  I'm not ready \n\t\tto die.\n\nHan breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him \ngo and the pirate breaks up the fight.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tChewie!  Chewie, this won't help \n\t\tme.  Hey!\n\nHan gives the Wookiee a stern look.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tSave your strength.  There'll be \n\t\tanother time.  The princess - you \n\t\thave to take care of her.  You \n\t\thear me?\n\nHan winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.\n\nIn a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too \ndistraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look \nsorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a \nfinal, passionate kiss.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tI love you!\n\n\t\t\t\tHAN\n\t\tI know.\n\nTears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to \nthe hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and \nthen, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in \nagony.\n\nLando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.\n\nInstantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and \nfluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns \naway from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tWhat... what's going on?  Turn \n\t\tround, Chewbacca, I can't see.  \n\t\tOh... they've encased him in \n\t\tcarbonite.  He should be quite \n\t\twell-protected - if he survives \n\t\tthe freezing process, that is.\n\nChewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an \nangry glance and bark.\n\nA huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate \nout of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush \nover and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the \ncoffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it \ninside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step \naway.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He \nshakes his head in relief.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tWell, Calrissian, did he survive?\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tYes, he's alive.  And in perfect \n\t\thibernation.\n\nVader turns to Boba Fett.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tHe's all yours bounty hunter.\n\t\tReset the chamber for Skywalker.\n\n\t\t\t\tIMPERIAL OFFICER\n\t\tSkywalker has just landed, my \n\t\tlord.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tGood.  See to it that he finds \n\t\this way here.  Calrissian, take \n\t\tthe princess and the Wookiee to \n\t\tmy ship.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tYou said they'd be left in the \n\t\tcity under my supervision.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tI am altering the deal.

CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nAs Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a \ngroup of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited \nseries of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops \nin his tracks with a feeble squeak.\n\nBoba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the \nfloating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, \nimmediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon \nand blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The \ntwo guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and \nfires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a \nhuge chunk of wall.\n\nLuke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, \nHan, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  \nLuke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a \nsecond hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time \nto see Luke.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tLuke!  Luke, don't - it's a \n\t\ttrap!  It's a trap!\n\nBefore she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears \nfrom sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing \nbehind.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM\n\nLuke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the \nothers are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the \ncorridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes \nslamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, \nechoing through the chamber.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM\n\nArtoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He \nwhistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the \nother direction.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM\n\nLuke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an \nopening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he \nstands on begins to move.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\n\nLuke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is \ndeathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else \nseems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.\n\nSteam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, \nLuke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters \nhis gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, \neager to engage his enemy.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tThe Force is with you, young \n\t\tSkywalker.  But you are not a \n\t\tJedi yet.\n\nLuke ignites his sword in answer.

CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\n\nLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, \nguarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where \nLobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.\n\nThe guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  \nTaking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia \nand one to Lando.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tWell done.

Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess \nand the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.

Luke aggressively \ndrives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tYou have learned much, young one.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tYou'll find I'm full of surprises.\n\nVader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and \nsending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the \nyouth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls \ndown the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he \nsprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up \nto see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls \naway as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his \nenemy.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tYour destiny lies with me, \n\t\tSkywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to \n\t\tbe true.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tNo!\n\nBehind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All \nthe while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.\n\nSuddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and \nfalls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant \nfreezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and \ndeactivates his sword.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tAll to easy.  Perhaps you are not \n\t\tas strong as the Emperor thought.\n\nThrough the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal \nbegins to pour into the pit.\n\nVader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped \nfifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the \ncarbonite outlet.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tImpressive... most impressive.\n\nLuke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the \nsteaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had \nfallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his \noutstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights \nhis sword as well.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tObi-Wan has taught you well.  You \n\t\thave controlled your fear... now \n\t\trelease your anger.\n\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as \nVader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he \nhas been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  \nAnother exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tOnly your hatred can destroy me.\n\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  \nHe lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to \nfill up with steam.\n\nVader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, \nbut looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The \nenergy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of \ncollapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of \nVader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers \nhimself into the pit.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM\n\nMoving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the \nreactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward \na large window as Vader enters.\n\nLuke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.\n\nBehind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall \nand comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in \nhalf just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, \nLuke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an \ninvisible shield.\n\nA large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  \nSparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  \nSmall tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all \nsides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is \nbloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes \nflying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, \nunmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.\n\nA piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.\n\nINT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT\n\nLuke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his \ndeactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to \nscramble up.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM\n\nLeia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the \ndoor to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a \nmoment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as \nstormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a \nrain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando \npunches desperately at the door's control panel.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tThe security codes has been changed!\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tArtoo, you can tell the computer \n\t\tto override the security system.\n\nThreepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps \nand scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's \nintercom.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tAttention!  This is Lando\n\t\tCalrissian.  The Empire has takes \n\t\tcontrol of the city.  I advise \n\t\teveryone to leave before more \n\t\tImperial troops arrive.\n\nArtoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the \nsocket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's \ncircuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out \nunderneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tThis way.\n\nLando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots \nalong with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tDon't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. \n\t\tI'm not supposed to know a power \n\t\tsocket from a computer terminal.\n\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\n\nIn a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.  \nSome carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.  \nSome are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.\n\nOther stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back \nat them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while \nThreepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?  We're \n\t\tnot interested in the hyperdrive \n\t\ton the Millennium Falcon.  It's \n\t\tfixed!  Just open the door, you \n\t\tstupid lump.\n\nChewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep \nfrom Artoo - and the door snaps open.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\t\t(to Artoo)\n\t\tI never doubted you for a second.\n\t\tWonderful!\n\nArtoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes \noutside.\n\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK\n\nThey race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers \nreaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the \ndroids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the \nThreepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tOuch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend \n\t\tdown, you thoughtless... Ow!\n\nChewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando \nand Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tLANDO\n\t\tLeia!  Go!\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR\n\nArtoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the \nFalcon.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHREEPIO\n\t\tI thought that hairy beast would \n\t\tbe the end of me.  Of course, I've \n\t\tlooked better.\n\nArtoo beeps understandingly.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nChewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches \nover their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship \nbegins to move.\n\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK\n\nThe Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars \naway from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in \npursuit.\n\nINT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT\n\nLuke moves along the railing and up to the control room.\n\nVader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet \nVader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke \nbackward toward the gantry.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tYou are beaten.  It is useless \n\t\tto resist.  Don't let yourself \n\t\tbe destroyed as Obi-Wan did.\n\nLuke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so \nviciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks \nand smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.\n\nLuke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at \nhim, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick \nmove around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  \nVader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins \nto fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.\n\nLuke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, \nVader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his \nhand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his \nforearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its \nextreme end.  Vader\nfollows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to \ngo.  \n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tThere is no escape.  Don't make \n\t\tme destroy you.  You do not yet \n\t\trealize your importance.  You \n\t\thave only begun to discover your \n\t\tpower.  Join me and I will complete \n\t\tyour training.  With our combined \n\t\tstrength, we can end this destructive \n\t\tconflict and bring order to the \n\t\tgalaxy.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'll never join you!\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tIf you only knew the power of the \n\t\tdark side.  Obi-Wan never told \n\t\tyou what happened to your father.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tHe told me enough!  It was you \n\t\twho killed him.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tNo.  I am your father.\n\nShocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tNo.  No.  That's not true!  \n\t\tThat's impossible!\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tSearch your feelings.  You know \n\t\tit to be true.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tNo!  No!  No!\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tLuke.  You can destroy the Emperor.\n\t\tHe has foreseen this.  It is your \n\t\tdestiny.  Join me, and together \n\t\twe can rule the galaxy as father \n\t\tand son.  Come with me.  It is the \n\t\tonly way.\n\nVader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.\n\nA calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant \nhe steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over \nthe platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow \nat Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the \nedge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, \nunable to grab onto anything to break his fall.\n\nINT. REACTOR SHAFT\n\nSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  \nWhen Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.\n\nINT. EXHAUST PIPE\n\nLuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.\n\nHe slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet \nhit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of \nthe pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.\n\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK\n\nUnable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the \nundermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to \ngrab onto on electronic weather vane.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tBen... Ben, please!\n\nLuke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  \nHe hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the \nwhile, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust \npipe.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tBen.  Leia!\n\nThere is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the\nweather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tHear me!  Leia!\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLeia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is \nbusy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a \nreadout on the control panel.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tLuke...

CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK\n\nThe Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.\n\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM\n\nVader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the \nFalcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.\n\nHe turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing \nplatform.\n\n\t\t\t\tVADER\n\t\tBring my shuttle.\n\nEXT.

BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE\n\nLuke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips \nfrom the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks \ntoward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up \nthrough the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally \nfalls from the vane into space.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nOut the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the \ncity.  The ship gains on him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEIA\n\t\tOkay.

Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE \r\nhas secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even \r\nmore powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this \r\nultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels \r\nstruggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\r\n\r\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive \r\nsuperstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of \r\na giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, \r\ngreen moon of ENDOR.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored \r\nspace station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial \r\nshuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the \r\nDeath Star.\r\n\r\n2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT \r\nThe shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.\r\n\r\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\r\nCommand station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting \r\nour approach. Deactivate the security shield.\r\n\r\nDEATH STAR CONTROLLER\t(filtered VO)\r\nThe security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have \r\nconfirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to \r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\r\nWe're starting our approach.\r\n\r\n3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits \r\nswitches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death \r\nStar, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible \r\ndeflector shield.\r\n\r\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\r\n\r\nOFFICER\r\nInform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\r\n\r\nOPERATOR\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial \r\nshuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial \r\nstormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\r\n\r\n4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, \r\nstrides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. \r\nThe troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. \r\nBut the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.\r\n\r\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only \r\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this \r\nblack void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the \r\nassemblage as he walks down the ramp.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nLord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your \r\npresence.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you \r\nback on\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nI assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nPerhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nI tell you, this station will be operational as planned.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nBut he asks the impossible. I need more men.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThen perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\t (aghast)\r\nThe Emperor's coming here?\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThat is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your \r\napparent lack of progress.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nWe shall double our efforts.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nI hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as \r\nI am.\r\n\r\n5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE\r\n\r\nA lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine \r\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before \r\ncatching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along \r\nthe road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and \r\npoor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles timidly.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this \r\nJabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.\r\n\r\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.\r\n\r\n6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE \r\n\r\nThreepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly \r\nknocks on the iron door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (instantly) \r\nThere doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master \r\nLuke.\r\n\r\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical \r\narm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects \r\nthe two droids.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE VOICE\r\nTee chuta hhat yudd!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGoodness gracious me!\r\n\r\n Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\r\n\r\n THREEPIO\r\n Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\r\n\r\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the \r\neye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his \r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.\r\n\r\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the \r\nmassive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The \r\nrobots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at \r\none another, afraid to enter.\r\n\r\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby \r\ncompanion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO \r\nArtoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should \r\nrush into all this.\r\n\r\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!\r\n\r\n7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY\r\n\r\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark \r\npassageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN \r\nGUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the \r\ntwo lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. \r\nArtoo beeps nervously.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! \r\nOh! Oh, no.\r\n\r\nWalking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike \r\nalien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nDie Wanna Wanga!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, \r\nJabba the Hutt.\r\n\r\nArtoo lets out a series of quick beeps.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (cont)\r\n...and a gift.\r\n(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)\r\nGift, what gift?\r\n\r\nBib shakes his head negatively.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nNee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\r\n\r\nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, \r\nletting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the \r\nstrange-looking alien.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.\r\n\r\nBib thinks about this for a moment.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort \r\nof things.\r\n\r\nBib gestures for the droids to follow.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nNudd Chaa.\r\n\r\nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed \r\nby the two guards.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, I have a bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\n8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES \r\never conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as \r\nthey pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts \r\npartially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the \r\nroom to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating \r\ncrowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a \r\nrepulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the \r\nhorrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At \r\nthe foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS \r\nCRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba \r\nlaughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows \r\npolitely.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGood morning.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBo Shuda!\r\n\r\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned \r\nvillain.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nThe message, Artoo, the message.\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, \r\ncreating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten \r\nfeet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke \r\nSkywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are \r\npowerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally \r\npowerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's \r\nlife. \r\n(Jabba's crowd laughs) \r\nWith your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which \r\nwill be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant \r\nconfrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: \r\nthese two droids.\r\n\r\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWhat did he say?\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (cont)\r\n... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.\r\n\r\nLuke's hologram disappears.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThere will be no bargain.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWe're doomed.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he \r\nis.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. \r\nHanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a \r\ncarbonized HAN SOLO.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\r\n\r\n9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR \r\n\r\nOne of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, \r\nshadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable \r\ncreatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm \r\nor tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps \r\npitifully.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? \r\nHe never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\r\n\r\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break \r\nfree, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.\r\n\r\n10   INT BOILER ROOM\r\n\r\nThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy \r\nmachinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are \r\nmet by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can \r\nbe seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work \r\ndroid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons \r\nare pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized \r\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-\r\n9D9.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI am See-Threepio, human-cy...\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nYes or no will do.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh. Well, yes.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nHow many languages do you speak?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can \r\nreadily...\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nSplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got \r\nangry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDisintegrated?\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\t (to a Gamorrean guard)\r\nGuard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining \r\nbolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\r\n\r\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (disappearing)\r\nArtoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!\r\n\r\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps \r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nNINEDENINE\r\nYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have \r\nneed for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in \r\nnicely.\r\n\r\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured \r\nelectronic scream.\r\n\r\n11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous \r\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a \r\nfat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.\r\n\r\nJabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons \r\nOola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, \r\nshaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nDa Eitha!\r\n\r\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\r\n\r\nOOLA\r\nNa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\r\n\r\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBoscka!\r\n\r\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the \r\nfloor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a \r\nmuffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous \r\nfriends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her \r\nfate through a grate.\r\n\r\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han \r\nSolo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.\u00caAn \r\nunnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the \r\nroom, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two \r\nguards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his \r\ncaptive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\r\n\r\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into \r\nhis ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens \r\nintently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a \r\ngreeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\r\nI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, no! Chewbacca!\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\r\n\r\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to \r\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!\r\n\r\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh \r\nlistens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices \r\nBOBA FETT standing near the door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the \r\nreward of twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\r\nI want fifty thousand. No less.\r\n\r\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the \r\nraised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his \r\nweapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the \r\nthrone. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nUh, oh... but what, what did I say?\r\n(to Boushh)\r\nUh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio \r\nlooks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The \r\ndroid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.\r\n\r\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the \r\nroom. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the \r\nbounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba \r\nstares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across \r\nhis vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThis bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\r\n\r\nJabba continues.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\r\n\r\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his \r\nreaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes \r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nZeebuss.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe agrees!\r\n\r\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and \r\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca \r\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a \r\nskiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing \r\ngirls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly \r\nappreciative creatures.\r\n\r\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the \r\nscene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across \r\nthe room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling \r\nhis weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\r\n\r\n12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL\r\n\r\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When \r\na tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes \r\nagainst the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. \r\nIt takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming \r\nthe door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the \r\niron door.\r\n\r\n13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE\r\n\r\nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in \r\nfront, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert \r\nrodent and burps in satisfaction.\r\n\r\n14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien \r\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several \r\ndrunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.\r\n\r\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of \r\nthe room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his \r\nway carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.\r\n\r\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his \r\ncoffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter \r\ndeactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of \r\nthe coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\r\n\r\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the \r\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches \r\nand, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization \r\nlever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the \r\ncontours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches \r\nas Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, \r\npreviously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His \r\nface muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\r\n\r\nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath \r\nof life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he \r\nbegins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\r\n\r\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nShhh. You have hibernation sickness.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI can't see.\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nYour eyesight will return in time.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhere am I?\r\n\r\nBOUSHH\r\nJabba's palace.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWho are you?\r\n\r\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, \r\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nSomeone who loves you.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLeia!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI gotta get you out of here.\r\n\r\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is \r\npierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat's that? I know that laugh.\r\n\r\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the \r\nHutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his \r\ngross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I \r\ngot a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.\r\n\r\nJabba laughs.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nIt's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but \r\nnow you're Bantha fodder.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLook...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)\r\nTake him away!\r\n\r\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. \r\nDon't be a fool!\r\n\r\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead \r\nLeia away.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nBring her to me.\r\n\r\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young \r\nprincess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly \r\nturns away in disgust.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI'm sure.\r\n\r\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly \r\nblob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nUgh!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOhhh, I can't bear to watch.\r\n\r\n15   INT DUNGEON CELL\r\n\r\nThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A \r\nguard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door \r\nslams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack \r\nin the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is \r\nheard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell \r\ndoor and listens.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie? Chewie, is that you?\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting \r\nhim off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, \r\nrevealing Chewie.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAh! Chew--Chewie!\r\n\r\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?\r\n\r\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less \r\nrescue anybody.\r\n\r\nChewie barks a reply.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets \r\ndelusions of grandeur.\r\n\r\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.\r\n\r\n16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE\r\n\r\nNoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT \r\nand reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a \r\nrobe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke \r\nstrides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block \r\nLuke's path. Luke halts.\r\n\r\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately \r\nlower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and \r\nmoves on down the hallway.\r\n\r\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they \r\napproach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his \r\ndirection and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the \r\nconversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI must speak with Jabba.\r\n\r\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and \r\nstares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou will take me to Jabba now!\r\n\r\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him \r\ninto the gloom.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou serve your master well.\r\n\r\nBib responds.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nAnd you will be rewarded.\r\n\r\n17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. \r\nSalacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now \r\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a \r\nmanacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. \r\nThreepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\r\n\r\nBIB\r\n...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nI told you not to admit him.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI must be allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nHe must be allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nYou weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\r\n\r\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nYour mind powers will not work on me, boy.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either \r\nprofit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not \r\nto underestimate my powers.\r\n\r\nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about \r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nMaster Luke, you're standing on...\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nThere will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\r\n\r\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies \r\ninto Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his \r\nhand.\r\n\r\nJABBA\r\nBascka!\r\n\r\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into \r\nthe pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba \r\nlaughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained \r\nby a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at \r\nhim and he shakes his head \"no.\"\r\n\r\n18   INT RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the \r\ndungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically \r\nfor help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in \r\nthe side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. \r\nLuke looks calmly around for a means of escape.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, no! The Rancor!\r\n\r\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged \r\nRANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries \r\nfutilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.\r\n\r\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the \r\nRancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few \r\nscreams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers \r\nand laughs at the guard's fate.\r\n\r\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just \r\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of \r\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his \r\nsalivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the \r\nmonster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in \r\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an \r\navalanche.\r\n\r\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes \r\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the \r\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility \r\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into \r\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it \r\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\r\n\r\n19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding \r\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he \r\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond \r\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the \r\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The \r\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, \r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for \r\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. \r\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the \r\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes \r\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on \r\nan egg.\r\n\r\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation \r\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning \r\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh \r\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\r\n\r\n21   INT RANCOR PIT\r\n\r\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead \r\nbeast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly \r\nat Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel \r\nand take Luke away.\r\n\r\n22   INT THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into \r\nthe throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHan!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nAre you all right?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nFine. Together again, huh?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWouldn't miss it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHow are we doing?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThe same as always.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?\r\n\r\nLuke looks to Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'm here.\r\n\r\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia \r\nlike a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from \r\nthe other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.\r\n\r\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed \r\nthat you are to be terminated immediately.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood, I hate long waits.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of \r\nCarkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (to Luke)\r\nDoesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as \r\nyou are slowly digested over a thousand years.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\r\n\r\nChewie barks his agreement.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever \r\nmake.\r\n\r\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\r\n\r\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer \r\nrises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but \r\nLuke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.\r\n\r\n23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF\r\n\r\nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by \r\ntwo smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, \r\nHan, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is \r\nLando in disguise.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a \r\nbig light blur.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nOh... great!\r\n\r\n24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His \r\nentire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. \r\nLeia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to \r\nher neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to \r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nSoon you will learn to appreciate me.\r\n\r\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller \r\ndroid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby \r\ndroid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\r\n\r\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. \r\nThey're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\r\n\r\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHmm.  I wish I had your confidence.\r\n\r\n25   EXT SARLACC PIT \r\n\r\nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one \r\nside of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's \r\nskiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of \r\nthe deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by \r\nthousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is \r\nextended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's \r\nbonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.\r\n\r\n26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward \r\nand the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps \r\nup to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of \r\nintergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across \r\nloudspeakers.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die \r\nhonorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba \r\nthe Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\r\n\r\n27   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get \r\nno such pleasure from us. Right?\r\n\r\nChewie growls his agreement.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\r\n\r\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look \r\nof conspiracy to him.\r\n\r\n28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips \r\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as \r\nhe speaks into the comlink.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nMove him into position.\r\n\r\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\r\n\r\n29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK\r\n\r\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. \r\nBelow, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the \r\nplank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a \r\njaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap \r\nopens in Artoo's domed head.\r\n\r\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\r\nPut him in.\r\n\r\n30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK\r\n\r\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the \r\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is \r\nhappening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his \r\nfingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him \r\nskyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of \r\nthe plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He \r\ncasually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has \r\nsent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.\r\n\r\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded \r\nhim off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The \r\nother guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber \r\nflashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.\r\n\r\n31   EXT SARLACC PIT\r\n\r\nA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and \r\nbegins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him \r\nand pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.\r\n\r\n32   INT SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the \r\nguards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures \r\nwatching the action from the window are in an uproar.\r\n\r\n33   EXT SKIFF \r\n\r\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of \r\nthe Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nEasy, Chewie.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts \r\nfrom a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of \r\nthe rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately \r\nabove the Sarlacc pit.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWhoa! Whoa! Help!\r\n\r\n34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket \r\npack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.\r\n\r\n35   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who \r\nhas freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, \r\nthe young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty \r\nhunter's gun in half.\r\n\r\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck \r\ngun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the \r\nrail.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie, you okay? Where is he?\r\n\r\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm okay, pal.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a \r\ncable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong \r\ncable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from \r\nthe wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight \r\nup to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable \r\nand stands free.\r\n\r\nAnother blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is \r\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHan! Chewie?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLando!\r\n\r\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets \r\nhim. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves \r\nin on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young \r\nJedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating \r\nthe guards from their midst.\r\n\r\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, \r\nguiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. \r\nHan searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold \r\nof the spear.\r\n\r\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the \r\nother skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his \r\narm, and aims his lethal appendage.\r\n\r\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\r\n\r\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand \r\nwhacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts \r\noff, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the \r\nside of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams \r\nas his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into \r\nthe mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a \r\nweak congratulations to Han.\r\n\r\n36   INT SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and \r\nthrows the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous \r\nneck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the \r\nchain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath \r\nthe tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his \r\nscum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms \r\nthrough its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia \r\nstruggles to free herself of her bondage.\r\n\r\n37   EXT SKIFF\r\n\r\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han \r\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously \r\nfrom a rope on the prisoner's skiff.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLando, grab it!\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nLower it!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm trying!\r\n\r\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han \r\nand almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, \r\nand Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot \r\ncatches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. \r\nThe wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit \r\nfrom the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.\r\n\r\nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han \r\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the \r\npit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!\r\n\r\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck \r\ngun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the \r\nskiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail \r\nBarge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up \r\nthe hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his \r\nhead. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks \r\nthe helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.\r\n\r\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who \r\nis in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron \r\nhas stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by \r\nlying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand \r\nmoves him closer to his final reward.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!\r\n\r\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let \r\ngo of the spear.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHold it! Whoa!\r\n\r\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.\r\n\r\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly \r\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nNo, wait! I thought you were blind!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\r\n\r\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate \r\nfires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and \r\nChewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!\r\n\r\n38   EXT UPPER DECK\r\n\r\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in \r\ntheir gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: \r\nLuke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. \r\nThe deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young \r\nJedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more \r\ngunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) \r\nracing for him, firing their laser pistols.\r\n\r\n39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK\r\n\r\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips \r\nthrough the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby \r\nlittle droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCome on. We gotta get out of here quick.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and \r\nscreaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out \r\none of the golden droid's eyes.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nNot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!\r\n\r\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, \r\ncrashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye \r\ndangling from a wire) hurry off.\r\n\r\n40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\r\n\r\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by \r\nguards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke \r\nturns to face another guard.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (to Leia)\r\nGet the gun! Point it at the deck!\r\n\r\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels \r\nthe gun around.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nPoint it at the deck!\r\n\r\nA laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, \r\nbut manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the \r\nguards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He \r\nflexes the hand; it still works.\r\n\r\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves \r\nas Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.\r\n\r\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, \r\ntumbling toward the sand.\r\n\r\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she \r\nhas brought around to point down at the deck.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome on!\r\n\r\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers \r\nLeia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun \r\nexplodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.\r\n\r\n41   EXT SKIFF  \r\n\r\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. \r\nLuke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLet's go! And don't forget the droids.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe're on our way.\r\n\r\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge \r\ncraft is on fire.\r\n\r\n42   EXT SAND DUNE\r\n\r\nThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next \r\nto it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff \r\nfloats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. \r\nWith a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled \r\nfrom the sand.\r\n\r\n43   EXT DUNE SEA\r\n\r\nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues \r\nits chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the \r\nbarge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.\r\n\r\n44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA\r\n\r\nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR \r\nTHE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, \r\npressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed \r\nby Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each \r\nsupporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his \r\nwound.\r\n\r\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It \r\nis the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing \r\nand a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThat's all any of us can see.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (blinking)\r\nThen I guess I'm getting better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind \r\ndies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. \r\nThreepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.\r\n\r\nHAN \t(turning to Luke)\r\nI've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (shrugging it off)\r\nI had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNo, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest \r\nthing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide \r\nawake nothing!\r\n\r\nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, \r\nmussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.\r\n\r\nLUKE \t(moving to his ship)\r\nI'll see you back at the fleet.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhy don't you leave that crate and come with us?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\r\n\r\nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.\r\n\r\nHAN\t\t\r\n(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's \r\nbetrayal and subsequent aide)\r\nGuess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nFigured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the \r\nrest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHe means \"You're welcome.\"\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nCome on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.\r\n\r\n44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE \r\n\r\nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and \r\npeels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and \r\ngrows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.\r\n\r\n45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the \r\ncanopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM \r\nFALCON.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI'll meet you back at the fleet.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (over comlink)\r\nHurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (over comlink)\r\nHey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.\r\n\r\nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of \r\nLuke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black \r\nglove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThat's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a \r\npromise to keep... to an old friend.\r\n\r\n46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR\r\n\r\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in \r\nspace above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, \r\nEndor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward \r\nthe Death Star.\r\n\r\n47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous \r\nDeath Star commander.\r\n\r\n48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth \r\ndocking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where \r\nthe shuttle is coming to rest.\r\n\r\nThe shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and \r\ncreate a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention \r\nwith a momentous SNAP.\r\n\r\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a \r\nrather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way \r\ndown the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak \r\nsimilar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's \r\nface is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow \r\neyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme \r\nRuler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (to Vader)\r\nRise, my friend.\r\n\r\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way \r\nalong the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay \r\nkneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several \r\nImperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the \r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue \r\nyour search for young Skywalker.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYes, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, \r\nyou must bring him\r\nbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the \r\ndark side of the\r\nForce.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nAs you wish.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nEverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\r\n\r\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial \r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH\r\n\r\nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of \r\nthe swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps \r\ndisconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm \r\nyellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.\r\n\r\n50   INT YODA'S HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of \r\nthe cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that \r\nclutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. \r\nHis manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\r\n\r\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look \r\nhas been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo... of course not.\r\n\r\nYODA\t (tickled, chuckles)\r\nI do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. \r\n(Points a crooked finger)\r\nWhen nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\r\n\r\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nSoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\r\n\r\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMaster Yoda, you can't die.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me \r\nand soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the \r\nForce.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nNo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\r\n\r\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen I am a Jedi?\r\n\r\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\r\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, \r\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\r\n\r\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his \r\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\r\n\r\nYoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile \r\ncreases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\r\n\r\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYoda, I must know.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nYour father he is.\r\n\r\nLuke reacts as if cut.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nTold you, did he?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nUnfortunate that I know the truth?\r\n\r\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\r\n\r\nYODA\t\t (gathering all his strength)\r\nNo. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your \r\ntraining. Not\r\nready for the burden were you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWell, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nRemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, \r\nfear, aggression.\r\nThe dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever \r\nwill it dominate your\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\r\n\r\nYODA\r\nLuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, \r\nor suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I\r\n(cough),\r\nthe last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your \r\nfamily. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... \r\n(with great effort)\r\nThere is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.\r\n\r\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green \r\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears \r\nin front of his eyes.\r\n\r\n51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING \r\n\r\nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, \r\nbut is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to \r\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (OS)\r\nYoda will always be with you.\r\n\r\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\r\n\r\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be \r\nAnakin Skywalker\r\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your \r\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a \r\ncertain point of view.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\r\nA certain point of view!\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend \r\ngreatly on our own\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it \r\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened \r\nto your father was my fault.\r\n\r\nBen pauses sadly.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nAnakin was a good friend.\r\n\r\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a \r\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was \r\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to \r\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well \r\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the \r\ngalaxy.\r\n\r\nLuke is entranced.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's still good in him.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be \r\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't do it, Ben.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience \r\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value \r\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you \r\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been \r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I had to help my friends.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\r\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved \r\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\r\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side \r\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest \r\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what \r\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're \r\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, \r\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI can't kill my own father.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYoda spoke of another.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut I have no sister.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your \r\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were \r\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the \r\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They \r\ndo you credit.\r\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\r\n\r\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\r\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your \r\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep \r\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you \r\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia \r\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\r\n\r\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\r\n\r\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\r\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in \r\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew \r\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, \r\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family \r\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster \r\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of \r\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the \r\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a \r\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she \r\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had \r\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became \r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his \r\nsister.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\r\n\r\nBEN\r\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, \r\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your \r\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy \r\nVader!\r\n\r\n52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a \r\ndozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and \r\nbattlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the \r\nHEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\r\n\r\n53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\r\n\r\nHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in \r\nthe WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a \r\nholographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the \r\nnearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern \r\nbut beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several \r\nmilitary leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a \r\nsalmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he \r\nfinds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.\r\n\r\nHan peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, look at you, a general, huh?\r\n\r\n LANDO\r\n Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the \r\nbattle of Taanab.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (sarcastic)\r\nWell, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I \r\ndidn't know they were\r\nlookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\r\n\r\nLANDO\t (smiling)\r\nI'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable \r\none, remember?\r\n\r\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA\r\nThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has \r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the \r\nDeath Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the \r\ncenter of the room.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA\r\nThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location \r\nof the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon \r\nsystems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial \r\nFleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is \r\nrelatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that \r\nthe Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the \r\nconstruction of this Death Star.\r\n\r\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia \r\nas Chewie barks his amazement.\r\n\r\nMON MOTHMA\t (cont)\r\nMany Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field \r\nand the Moon of Endor.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. \r\nAlthough the weapon\r\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does \r\nhave a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, \r\nwhich is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield \r\nmust be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield \r\nis down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly \r\ninto the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\r\n\r\nThere's a concerned murmur.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\t (cont)\r\nGeneral Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\r\n\r\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nLando nods his thanks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou're gonna need it.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nGeneral Madine.\r\n\r\nMadine moves center stage.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MADINE\r\nWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and \r\nusing a secret\r\nImperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the \r\nshield generator.\r\n\r\nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nSounds dangerous.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (to Han)\r\nI wonder who they found to pull that off.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MADINE\r\nGeneral Solo, is your strike team assembled?\r\n\r\nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nUh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.\r\n\r\nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.\r\n\r\nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (smiles)\r\nThat's one.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nUh, General... count me in.\r\n\r\nVOICE\t (OS)\r\nI'm with you, too!\r\n\r\nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more \r\ncheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and \r\nLeia are surprised and delighted.\r\n\r\nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him \r\nand looks into his eyes questioningly.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\n What is it?\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (hesitant)\r\nAsk me again sometime.\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHi, Han... Chewie.\r\n\r\nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.\r\n\r\n THREEPIO\r\n\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.\r\n\r\n54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which \r\nlooks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. \r\nChewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up \r\nthe shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and \r\nsupplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-\r\nbyes and start up the ramp.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the \r\nhelp you can get. She's\r\nthe fastest ship in the fleet.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take \r\ngood care of her.\r\nShe-she won't get a scratch. All right?\r\n\r\nHAN\t (looks at him warmly)\r\nRight. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nLook, would you get going, you pirate.\r\n\r\nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou, too.\r\n\r\nHan goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.\r\n\r\n55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLuke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the \r\npilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out \r\nall the Imperial controls.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou got her warmed?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYeah, she's comin' up.\r\n\r\nChewie growls a complaint.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNo. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed \r\nher, Chewie.\r\n\r\nLeia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.\r\n\r\nChewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on \r\nsomething out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him \r\ngently.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHey, are you awake?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.\r\n\r\nChewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the \r\nFalcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (softly)\r\nCome on, General, let's move.\r\n\r\nHan snaps back to life.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nRight. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, \r\neverybody?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nAll set.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHere we go again.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAll right, hang on.\r\n\r\n56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the \r\nHeadquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms \r\noff into space.\r\n\r\n57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at \r\nthe far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair \r\nbefore a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death \r\nStar to the giant green moon of Endor.\r\n\r\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, \r\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After \r\nseveral tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhat is thy bidding, my Master?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until \r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nIt is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young \r\nSkywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go \r\nout to the command ship and await my orders.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYes, my Master.\r\n\r\nVader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks \r\ntoward the waiting council members.\r\n\r\n58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction \r\nproceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star \r\nDestroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces \r\nitself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.\r\n\r\n59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nHan looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. \r\nThrough the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star \r\nDestroyer can be seen.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIf they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty \r\nquick, Chewie.\r\n\r\nChewie growls his agreement.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\r\nWe have you on our screen now. Please identify.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nShuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\r\nShuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nTransmission commencing.\r\n\r\nLeia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed \r\ntransmission begins.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nNow we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt'll work. It'll work.\r\n\r\nChewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer \r\nthat looms ever larger before them.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nVader's on that ship.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNow don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep \r\nyour distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep \r\nyour distance.\r\n\r\nChewie barks a question.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI don't know.  Fly casual.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.\r\n\r\nChewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out \r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. \r\nNow, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment \r\nof stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL \r\nPIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen \r\nearlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nWhere is that shuttle going?\r\n\r\nPIETT\t (into comlink)\r\nShuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?\r\n\r\nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)\r\nParts and technical crew for the forest moon.\r\n\r\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nDo they have a code clearance?\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.\r\n\r\nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nShall I hold them?\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nNo. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\r\n\r\nPIETT\t (surprised)\r\nAs you wish, my lord.\r\n(to controller)\r\nCarry on.\r\n\r\nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.\r\n\r\n61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nThe group waits tensely.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThey're not goin' for it, Chewie.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER\t (filtered)\r\nShuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. \r\nFollow your\r\npresent course.\r\n\r\nEveryone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks \r\nworried. Chewie barks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nOkay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.\r\n\r\n62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR\r\n\r\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.\r\n\r\n63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR\r\n\r\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, \r\nprimeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\r\n\r\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a \r\nsteep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The \r\ntroops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio \r\nbringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\r\n\r\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly \r\nto the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke \r\ncrawl up to take a look.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, I told you it was dangerous here.\r\n\r\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering \r\nthrough bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked \r\nnearby.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nShall we try and go around?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nIt'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.\r\n\r\nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie \r\nstart quietly down.\r\n\r\n64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE\r\n\r\nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far \r\nfrom the two Imperial scouts.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nQuietly, there might be more of them out there.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (grins)\r\nHey... it's me.\r\n\r\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. \r\nLuke and Leia exchange smiles.\r\n\r\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout \r\nwhirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #1\r\nGo for help! Go!\r\n\r\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie \r\ngets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to \r\ncrash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (sarcastic)\r\nGreat. Come on.\r\n\r\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol \r\ndrawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where \r\ntwo more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied \r\nbike parked nearby.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOver there! Two more of them!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI see them. Wait, Leia!\r\n\r\nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She \r\nstarts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls)\r\nQuick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\r\n\r\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely \r\navoiding two huge trees.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, wait! Ahhh!\r\n\r\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\r\n\r\n65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE\r\n\r\nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia \r\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from \r\ntheir bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nMove closer!\r\n\r\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer \r\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, \r\nslowing the scout.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGet alongside that one!\r\n\r\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their \r\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of \r\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him \r\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike \r\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the \r\nremaining scout.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nGet him!\r\n\r\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing \r\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser \r\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a \r\nglancing hit.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\r\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\r\n\r\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into \r\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as \r\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and \r\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a \r\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted \r\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\r\n\r\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into \r\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\r\n\r\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom \r\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and \r\nrises out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia \r\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes \r\na glancing hit.\r\n\r\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches \r\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has \r\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike \r\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. \r\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a \r\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a \r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue \r\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The \r\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a \r\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top \r\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a \r\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside \r\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all \r\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able \r\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the \r\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are \r\nmoving as one.\r\n\r\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and \r\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's \r\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find \r\nLuke.\r\n\r\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and \r\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and \r\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it \r\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, \r\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty \r\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, \r\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\r\n\r\n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait \r\nanxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed \r\nhead and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\r\n\r\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's \r\ntoo tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLuke! Where's Leia?\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (concerned)\r\nWhat? She didn't come back?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI thought she was with you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWe got separated.\r\n\r\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHey, we better go look for her.\r\n\r\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nTake the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.\r\n\r\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the \r\nsquad proceeds in another.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nDon't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.\r\n\r\nThey move off into the woods.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo)\r\nAnd you said it was pretty here. Ugh!\r\n\r\n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\r\n\r\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into \r\nview. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat \r\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this \r\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up \r\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where \r\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and \r\ndisheveled.\r\n\r\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a \r\ndefensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins \r\npoking her with the sharp point of the spear.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCut it out!\r\n\r\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\r\n\r\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of \r\nher speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here \r\nis.\r\n\r\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from \r\nher fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log \r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\r\n\r\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia \r\npats the log again.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\r\n\r\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nAll right. You want something to eat?\r\n\r\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. \r\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously \r\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\r\n\r\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the \r\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps \r\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her \r\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery \r\nlittle thing, aren't you?\r\n\r\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming \r\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to \r\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning \r\nto Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log \r\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding \r\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears \r\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the \r\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL \r\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches \r\nout his hand for her weapon.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #l\r\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\r\n\r\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage \r\nin front of the log.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #1\r\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\r\n\r\nSCOUT #2\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the \r\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout \r\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. \r\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, \r\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and \r\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's \r\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once \r\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards \r\nLeia with\u00canew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking \r\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the \r\ndense foliage.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nCome on, let's get outta here.\r\n\r\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and \r\ntugs at Leia to follow him.\r\n\r\n68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER\r\n\r\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private \r\nelevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\r\n\r\nVADER        \r\n(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the \r\nForce)\r\nThe Emperor will see me, now!\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\n(repeating Vader's command)\r\nThe Emperor will see you, now.\r\n\r\n69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens \r\nto reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It \r\nappears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He \r\nwaits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark \r\nLord.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nI told you to remain on the command ship.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (no surprise)\r\nYes, I know.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (after a beat)\r\nMy son is with them.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (very cool)\r\nAre you sure?\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nI have felt him, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are \r\nclear, Lord\r\nVader.\r\n\r\nVader knows what is being asked.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThey are clear, my Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (skeptical)\r\nHe will come to me?\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will \r\ncome to you and\r\nthen you will bring him before me.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (bows)\r\nAs you wish.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\r\n\r\n70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\r\n\r\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move \r\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. \r\nLuke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (OS)\r\nLuke! Luke!\r\n\r\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage \r\nof a speeder bike in the grass.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Master Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\r\n\r\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (gravely)\r\nI hope she's alright.\r\n\r\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off \r\nthrough the foliage.\r\n\r\n                              HAN\r\nWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!\r\n\r\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, \r\nArtoo whistles nervously.\r\n\r\n71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE\r\n\r\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a \r\ntall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from \r\nit.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, I don't get it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nNah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.\r\n\r\nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nChewie, wa-wait!  Don't!\r\n\r\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. \r\nSPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, \r\nsuspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of \r\nbeeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a \r\njumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this \r\nthing. \r\n(trying to free an arm) \r\nHan, can you reach my lightsaber?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYeah, sure.\r\n\r\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting \r\nappendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an \r\narm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to \r\nspin.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-\r\nop!!\r\n\r\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, \r\ncrashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they \r\nrealize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long \r\nspear.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\r\n\r\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok \r\nwarrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. \r\nHe grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey!\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHan, don't. It'll be all right.\r\n\r\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets \r\nthem take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nChewie, give 'em your crossbow.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free \r\nof the net and sits up, rattled.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\r\n\r\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among \r\nthemselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok \r\nnearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In \r\na moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled \r\nbark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks \r\nbegin to chant at Threepio.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nDo you understand anything they're saying?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million \r\nforms of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat are you telling them?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive \r\ndialect.  But\r\nI do believe they think I am some sort of god.\r\n\r\nChewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange \r\n\"what next?\" looks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nProper?!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\r\n\r\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhy, you--\r\n\r\nSeveral Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their \r\ngod. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a \r\nmenacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands \r\nplacatingly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\r\n\r\n72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their \r\nprisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and \r\nwrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\r\n\r\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the \r\ncaptives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the \r\nremaining creatures.\r\n\r\n73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST\r\n\r\nThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the \r\ngiant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into \r\nnothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts \r\nand rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes \r\nhold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other \r\nEwoks follow suit.\r\n\r\n74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE\r\n\r\nThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks \r\ngather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the \r\nnewcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\r\n\r\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is \r\nplaced on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others \r\nare leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently \r\nplaced near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and \r\nChewie are less than fascinated.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI have a really bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\nChewie growls his concern.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes \r\nout of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join \r\nThreepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A \r\nlarger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber \r\nwith great curiosity.\r\n\r\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing \r\nto the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit \r\nunder Han with firewood.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat did he say?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the \r\nmain course at a\r\nbanquet in my honor.\r\n\r\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. \r\nLeia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening \r\nat the same moment the prisoners see her.\r\n\r\nHAN and LUKE\r\nLeia!\r\n\r\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOh!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYour Royal Highness.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the \r\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nBut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.\r\n\r\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads \r\nnegatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks \r\nsome orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue \r\nwith vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry \r\nand use your magic.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nJust tell them.\r\n\r\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps \r\nforward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to \r\nconcentrate.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\r\n\r\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the \r\nground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\n... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! \r\nOh!\r\n\r\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio \r\nbegins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio \r\ncalling out in total panic at his situation.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! \r\nMaster Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\r\n\r\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and \r\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group \r\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at \r\nhim, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. \r\nLogray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. \r\nWhen the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo \r\nbeeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, \r\nfinally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The \r\nEwok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group \r\nof Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and \r\nmarveling at his height.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThanks, Threepio.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken)\r\nI...I never knew I had it in me.\r\n\r\n75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS\r\n\r\nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, \r\ncreating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a \r\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. \r\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the \r\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\r\n\r\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's \r\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally \r\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the \r\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, \r\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. \r\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable \r\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\r\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\r\n\r\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han \r\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in \r\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\r\n\r\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer \r\nand screeches.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWhat's going on?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something \r\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not \r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nJust what I always wanted.\r\n\r\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket \r\nclings to Han's leg.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (chuckles)\r\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. \r\n(to Wicket) \r\nThank you. Okay.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield \r\ngenerator.\r\n\r\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders \r\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try \r\nand get our weapons back.\r\n\r\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.\r\n\r\n76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and \r\nflicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft \r\nnight air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands \r\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, what's wrong?\r\n\r\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nWhat do you remember?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nTell me.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\n(a little surprised at his insistence)\r\nShe was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.\r\n(looks up)\r\nWhy are you asking me all this?\r\n\r\nHe looks away.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, tell me. What's troubling you?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nVader is here...now, on this moon.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (alarmed)\r\nHow do you know?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. \r\nThat's why I have to go.\r\n(facing her)\r\nAs long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.\r\n(beat)\r\nI have to face him.\r\n\r\nLeia is distraught, confused.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nHe's my father.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nYour father?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I \r\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\r\n\r\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and \r\ncould never have.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to \r\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has \r\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\r\n\r\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she \r\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYes. It's you Leia.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen you know why I have to face him.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave \r\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nBut, why must you confront him?\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to \r\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I \r\nhave to try.\r\n\r\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\r\n\r\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He \r\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed \r\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and \r\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only \r\nnow that she is crying.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, what's goin' on?\r\n\r\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (angry)\r\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\r\n\r\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI...I can't tell you.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\r\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI...\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAhhh...\r\n\r\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm sorry.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHold me.\r\n\r\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.\r\n\r\n77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM\r\n\r\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands \r\ngracefully on the huge platform.\r\n\r\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of \r\nthe forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks \r\nparticularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\r\n\r\n78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK\r\n\r\nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into \r\nan elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward \r\nanother ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, \r\nin binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with \r\ncomplete calm.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I \r\nbelieve there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct \r\na further search of the area.\r\n\r\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nHe was armed only with this.\r\n\r\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the \r\nlightsaber from the commander's hand.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his \r\ncompanions to me.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nYes, my Lord.\r\n\r\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone \r\nin the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest \r\nfilter in upon them.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThe Emperor has been expecting you.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI know, father.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nSo, you have accepted the truth.\r\n\r\nLURE\r\nI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (turning to face him)\r\nThat name no longer has any meaning for me.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there \r\nis good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is \r\nwhy you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your \r\nEmperor now.\r\n\r\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved \r\nhand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (indicating lightsaber)\r\nI see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\r\n\r\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, \r\nbrilliant blade.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has \r\nforeseen.\r\n\r\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nCome with me.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nObi-Wan once thought as you do.\r\n\r\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIf that is your destiny.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nSearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict \r\nwithin you. Let go\r\nof your hate.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature \r\nof the Force. He is\r\nyour master now.\r\n\r\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring \r\nat one another for a long moment.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nThen my father is truly dead.\r\n\r\n79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, \r\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield \r\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing \r\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that \r\nlanding platform. This\r\nisn't gonna be easy.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily \r\nguarded than this.\r\n\r\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to \r\nThreepio.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWhat's he saying?\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\r\n\r\n80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star \r\nCruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a \r\nspot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\r\n\r\n81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some \r\ngetting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando \r\nspeaks into his comlink.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.\r\n\r\nACKBAR \t(VO)\r\nProceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\r\n\r\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nDon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down \r\non time...\r\n(to himself) \r\nor this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.\r\n\r\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\t (VO)\r\nAll craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right. Stand by.\r\n\r\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\r\n\r\n82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\r\n\r\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then \r\nAckbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS \r\nINTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\r\n\r\n83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and \r\nPaploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is \r\nspread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that \r\nleads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes \r\nparked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an \r\nobservation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nBack door, huh? Good idea.\r\n\r\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (cont)\r\nIt's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (with self-confident grin)\r\nThen we'll do it real quiet-like.\r\n\r\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks \r\nchatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers \r\ninto the underbrush.\r\n\r\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nQuiet.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOh, no.\r\n\r\n84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial \r\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto \r\none of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at \r\nrandom. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. \r\nPaploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in \r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n85   EXT RIDGE\r\n\r\nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\r\n\r\nHAN \t(sighs)\r\nThere goes our surprise attack.\r\n\r\n86   EXT BUNKER\r\n\r\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into \r\nmotion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.\r\n\r\nSCOUT\r\nLook! Over there! Stop him!\r\n\r\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away \r\nin pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.\r\n\r\n87   EXT RIDGE\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. \r\nWe'll take care of this.\r\n\r\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. \r\nThreepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nI have decided that we shall stay here.\r\n\r\n88   EXT FOREST\r\n\r\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, \r\nbut he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him \r\nand begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds \r\na tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the \r\ntrees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the \r\nstill-flying, unoccupied bike.\r\n\r\n89   EXT BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the \r\nshoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms \r\nof the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps \r\nout a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out \r\nof sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No \r\nsign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout \r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk \r\nacross the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side \r\nby side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.\r\n\r\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down \r\nat Luke's binders.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou no longer need those.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders \r\nfall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, \r\nfree now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGuards, leave us.\r\n\r\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (to Luke)\r\nI'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call \r\nme Master.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. \r\nThe Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can \r\nperceive the evil visage within the hood.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are \r\nmistaken...about a great many things.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nHis lightsaber.\r\n\r\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's \r\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know \r\nyour father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with \r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor laughs.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\r\n\r\nLuke looks up sharply.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\r\n\r\nVader looks at Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYour overconfidence is your weakness.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour faith in your friends is yours.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nIt is pointless to resist, my son.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (angry)\r\nEverything that has transpired has done so according to my design. \r\n(indicates Endor)\r\nYour friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\r\n\r\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (cont)\r\n...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who \r\nallowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It \r\nis quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my \r\nbest troops awaits them.\r\n\r\nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword \r\nin the Emperor's hand.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nOh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when \r\nyour friends arrive.\r\n\r\n91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and \r\nenter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. \r\nLeia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nCharges!  Come on, come on!\r\n\r\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more \r\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at \r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket)\r\nOh, my! They'll be captured!\r\n\r\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into \r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.\r\n\r\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial \r\ncommander enters.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nFreeze! You Rebel scum.\r\n\r\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them \r\nand their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. \r\nEven more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. \r\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks.

See for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. \r\nLuke moves to look through a small section of the window.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and \r\nthe end of your insignificant Rebellion.\r\n\r\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest \r\nof the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the \r\nlightsaber.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your \r\nJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to \r\nyour anger.

The surrounding area, deserted before, is now \r\ncrowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial \r\ntroops. The situation looks hopeless.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!\r\n\r\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps \r\nand whistles. \r\nAnd --\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?\r\n\r\nBUNKER COMMANDER\r\nBring those two down here!\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nLet's go!\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six \r\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids \r\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nFreeze! Don't move!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nWe surrender.\r\n\r\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting \r\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a \r\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\r\n\r\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK \r\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their \r\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and \r\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting \r\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the \r\ntrees above.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for \r\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes \r\nto the bunker door control panel.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nHere's the terminal.\r\n\r\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\r\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\r\n\r\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround \r\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of \r\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, \r\nruns after him.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? \r\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\r\n\r\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the \r\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\r\n\r\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They \r\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns \r\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks \r\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker \r\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge \r\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\r\n\r\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's \r\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged \r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts \r\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between \r\ntwo trees.\r\n\r\n100  EXT SPACE\r\n\r\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat \r\nwith Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the \r\nRebel armada.\r\n\r\n101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel \r\nsquads.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWatch yourself, Wedge!

Another Rebel ship \r\nexplodes against the protective shield.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now \r\nwitness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle \r\nstation.\r\n(into comlink)\r\nFire at will, Commander.\r\n\r\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the \r\nRebel fleet beyond.\r\n\r\n105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands \r\nover them.\r\n\r\nJERJERROD\r\nFire!\r\n\r\n106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\r\n\r\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded \r\nImperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of \r\nlight emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side \r\nat a control panel.\r\n\r\n107  EXT DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to \r\nglow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.\r\n\r\n108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings \r\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is \r\nhit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE \r\nfighters.\r\n\r\n109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. \r\nLando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star \r\nfirepower.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nThat blast came from the Death Star!

Come on!\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Artoo, hurry!\r\n\r\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A \r\nlarge explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally \r\nlanding on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and \r\nsmoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn \r\naround to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his \r\nappendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in \r\nhis body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded \r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI'll cover you.\r\n\r\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the \r\nstormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the \r\nwing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting \r\nlaser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are \r\nstruck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then \r\nrealizes that he is dead.\r\n\r\n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death \r\nStar's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star \r\nDestroyers.\r\n\r\n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating \r\ngiants. He's been yelling into the comlink.\r\n\r\nLANDO\t (desperately)\r\nYes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star \r\nDestroyers at point-\r\nblank range.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might \r\njust take a few of\r\nthem with us.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and \r\nbegin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the \r\ngiant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.\r\n\r\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\r\n\r\nREBEL PILOT\r\nShe's gonna blow!\r\n\r\nY-WING PILOT\r\nI'm hit!\r\n\r\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into \r\nthe control tower, exploding.\r\n\r\n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being \r\ndecimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there \r\nis no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not \r\nsurvive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will \r\ndie...as will your friends.\r\n\r\nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! \r\nStrike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark \r\nside will be complete.\r\n\r\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He \r\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber \r\nflashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the \r\nEmperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his \r\nfather.\r\n\r\n115  EXT FOREST\r\n\r\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated \r\nweapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the \r\nImperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.\r\n\r\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An \r\nEwok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The \r\nlogs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until \r\nit finally topples over with a great crash.\r\n\r\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end \r\nof the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-\r\ntightening circles until it runs out of rope and\r\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\r\n\r\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks \r\ncling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, \r\nthen hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.\r\n\r\nWALKER PILOT #1\r\nLook!\r\n\r\nPILOT #2\r\nGet him off of there!\r\n\r\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked \r\nout and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into \r\nthe cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are \r\nthrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, \r\nChewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch \r\nwith a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to \r\nlisten to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\r\n\r\nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at \r\nunsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The \r\nEwoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the \r\nbattle in their favor.\r\n\r\n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to \r\nhotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some \r\nstormtroopers.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI think I got it. I got it!\r\n\r\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a \r\nsecond blast door crashes down in front of the first.\r\n\r\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with \r\nstormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her \r\nshoulder hit by a laser blast.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nLet's see.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nIt's not bad.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS)\r\nFreeze!\r\n\r\nThey freeze.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nOh, dear.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nDon't move!\r\n\r\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two \r\nstormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment \r\nseems suspended in time.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI love you.\r\n\r\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nSTORMTROOPER\r\nHands up! Stand up!\r\n\r\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She \r\ndisposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward \r\nLeia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, \r\nits deadly weapons aimed right at him.\r\n\r\nHAN\t (to Leia)\r\nStay back.\r\n\r\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and \r\nbarks triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nChewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.\r\n\r\n117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even \r\nmore vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown \r\nstronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is \r\nforced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke \r\nstands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR (laughing)\r\nGood.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through \r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and \r\nrealizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his \r\nlightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nObi-Wan has taught you well.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not fight you, father.\r\n\r\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou are unwise to lower your defenses.\r\n\r\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in \r\nan amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader \r\nstands below him.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the \r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nThere is no conflict.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe \r\nyou'll destroy me\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, \r\nthen you will meet\r\nyour destiny.\r\n\r\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding \r\nthe catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground \r\nin a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's \r\nplatform. Vader moves to find him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\t (laughs)\r\nGood.  Good.\r\n\r\n118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each \r\nother in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer \r\nexplodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a \r\nseries of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next \r\nto a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the \r\nImperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack \r\none of the larger Imperial ships.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWatch out.

Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the \r\nroof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\r\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\r\n\r\n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\r\n\r\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant \r\nexplosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nThrow me another charge.\r\n\r\n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, \r\nsearching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nYou cannot hide forever, Luke.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nI will not fight you.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your \r\nfriends. Yes, your\r\nthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially \r\nfor...\r\n\r\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in \r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed \r\nher, too. Obi-Wan\r\nwas wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will \r\nnot turn to the dark\r\nside, then perhaps she will.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNever-r-r!\r\n\r\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather \r\nwith a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader \r\nfight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of \r\nthe low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. \r\nEach stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to \r\nblock another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the \r\nwrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical \r\nstump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the\r\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves \r\nover Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. \r\nThe Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and \r\ntake your father's\r\nplace at my side!\r\n\r\nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, \r\nblack-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his \r\nfather. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in \r\npreparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. \r\nI am a Jedi,\r\nlike my father before me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nSo be it...Jedi.\r\n\r\n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\r\n\r\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across \r\nthe clearing.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nMove! Move!\r\n\r\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a \r\nspectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes \r\nalong with the bunker.\r\n\r\n124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nThe shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nWe're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. \r\n(laughs)\r\nTold you they'd do it!\r\n\r\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward \r\nthe unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\r\n\r\n125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\r\n\r\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The \r\nEmperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's \r\nhands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the \r\nForce to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a \r\nmoment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the \r\nyoung Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader \r\nstruggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\r\n\r\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the \r\nEmperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into \r\nthe bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You \r\nhave paid the price for\r\nyour lack of vision.\r\n\r\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward \r\nwhere Vader stands watching.\r\n\r\nLUKE\t (groans)\r\nFather, please. Help me.\r\n\r\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, \r\nthen back to Luke on the floor.\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\nNow, young Skywalker...you will die.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts \r\nfrom the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound \r\nscreaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.\r\n\r\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed \r\nfigure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. \r\nThe Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now \r\nlifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to \r\nstrike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his \r\nhelmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high \r\nover his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of \r\nthe throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, \r\nDarth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls \r\ninto the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it \r\nexplodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is \r\nwhipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the \r\nbottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away \r\nfrom the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant \r\nwarrior are too weak to move.\r\n\r\n126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star \r\nto the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of \r\nthe giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nI'm going in.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nHere goes nothing.\r\n\r\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed \r\nby the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who \r\ncontinually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as \r\nthey race through the dark shaft.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nNow lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power \r\ngenerator.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nForm up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\r\n\r\nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by \r\nthe TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nSplit up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of \r\nthose TIE fighters to\r\nfollow you.\r\n\r\nPILOT\r\nCopy, Gold Leader.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and \r\nWedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon \r\nscrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast \r\naway at them.\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nThat was too close.\r\n\r\nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages \r\non. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.\r\n\r\n127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nWe've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on \r\nthat Super Star Destroyer.\r\n\r\nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.\r\n\r\n128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the \r\nbattle. They look concerned.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER\r\nSir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nIntensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.\r\n\r\nThe commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel \r\nfighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.\r\n\r\nPIETT\r\nIntensify forward firepower!\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER\r\nIt's too late!\r\n\r\nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a \r\nhuge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the \r\nDeath Star, and explodes.\r\n\r\n129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. \r\nThey cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.\r\n\r\n130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\r\n\r\nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as \r\nthe Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading \r\na heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and \r\ndesperate to escape.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous \r\ndeadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. \r\nFinally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as \r\nVader draws him closer.\r\n\r\nVADER\t (a whisper)\r\nLuke, help me take this mask off.\r\n\r\nLURE\r\nBut you'll die.\r\n\r\nVADER\r\nNothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my \r\nown eyes.\r\n\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There \r\nbeneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the \r\ndying man smiles at the sight before him.\r\n\r\nANAKIN\t (very weak)\r\nNow...go, my son. Leave me.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nNo. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save \r\nyou.\r\n\r\nANAKIN\r\nYou already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you \r\nwere right.\r\n\r\nLUKE\r\nFather...I won't leave you.\r\n\r\nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.\r\n\r\nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half \r\ncarrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a \r\nshuttle.\r\n\r\n131  EXT DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense \r\nsuperstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers \r\noutside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is \r\nanswered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station \r\nitself.\r\n\r\n132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS\r\n\r\nLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing \r\nBaron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor \r\nshaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nThere it is!\r\n\r\nLANDO\r\nAll right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.\r\n\r\nWEDGE\r\nCopy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.\r\n\r\nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several \r\nproton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small \r\nexplosions.\r\n\r\nThe Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously \r\nclose, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a \r\npowerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.\r\n\r\nHe maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of \r\nthe continuing chain of explosions.\r\n\r\n133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, \r\nwatching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing \r\nroom.\r\n\r\nACKBAR\r\nMove the fleet away from the Death Star.\r\n\r\n134  EXT DEATH STAR\r\n\r\nAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the \r\nmain docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown \r\naway.\r\n\r\nFinally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando \r\nexpertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and \r\nwhizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star \r\nsupernovas into oblivion.\r\n\r\n135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\r\n\r\nLando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.\r\n\r\n136  EXT ENDOR FOREST\r\n\r\nHan and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all \r\nlook to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of \r\nself-destruction. They all cheer.\r\n\r\nTHREEPIO\r\nThey did it!\r\n\r\nHan looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. \r\nLeia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent \r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nI'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nHe wasn't. I can feel it.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nYou love him, don't you?\r\n\r\nLeia smiles, puzzled.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHAN\r\nAll right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the \r\nway.\r\n\r\nShe realizes his misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nLEIA\r\nOh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.\r\n\r\nHan is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.\r\n\r\n137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\nLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his \r\nfather's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, \r\nwatching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader -- \r\nAnakin Skywalker.\r\n\r\nIn the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the \r\nforest.\r\n\r\n138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and \r\nEwoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, \r\ndancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and \r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nLando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then, \r\nfinally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. \r\nThey stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's \r\ntouch, together to the end.\r\n\r\nRebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original \r\ngroup of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems \r\ndistracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHe looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at \r\nthe edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT\r\n\r\nEND CREDITS OVER STAR FIELD\r\n"}}
